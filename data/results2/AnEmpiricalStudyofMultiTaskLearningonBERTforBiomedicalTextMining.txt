Abstract
Multi-task learning (MTL) has achieved re-
markable success in natural language process-
ing applications.
In this work, we study a
multi-task learning model with multiple de-
coders on varieties of biomedical and clini-
cal natural language processing tasks such as
text similarity, relation extraction, named en-
tity recognition, and text inference. Our em-
pirical results demonstrate that the MTL ﬁne-
tuned models outperform state-of-the-art trans-
former models (e.g., BERT and its variants)
by 2.0% and 1.3% in biomedical and clinical
domains, respectively. Pairwise MTL further
demonstrates more details about which tasks
can improve or decrease others. This is par-
ticularly helpful in the context that researchers
are in the hassle of choosing a suitable model
for new problems. The code and models are
publicly available at https://github.com/

Introduction
Multi-task learning (MTL) is a ﬁeld of machine
learning where multiple tasks are learned in paral-
lel while using a shared representation (Caruana,
1997). Compared with learning multiple tasks indi-
vidually, this joint learning effectively increases the
sample size for training the model, thus leads to per-
formance improvement by increasing the general-
ization of the model (Zhang and Yang, 2017). This
is particularly helpful in some applications such as
medical informatics where (labeled) datasets are
hard to collect to fulﬁll the data-hungry needs of
deep learning.
MTL has long been studied in machine learn-
ing (Ruder, 2017) and has been used success-
fully across different applications, from natural
language processing (Collobert and Weston, 2008;
Luong et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019c), computer
vision (Wang et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2019a; Chen
et al., 2019), to health informatics (Zhou et al.,
2011; He et al., 2016; Harutyunyan et al., 2019).
MTL has also been studied in biomedical and clin-
ical natural language processing (NLP) such as
named entity recognition and normalization and the
relation extraction. However, most of these studies
focus on either one task with multi corpora (Khan
et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019b) or multi-tasks on
a single corpus (Xue et al., 2019; Li et al., 2017;
Zhao et al., 2019).
To bridge this gap, we investigate the use of MTL
with transformer-based models (BERT) on multiple
biomedical and clinical NLP tasks. We hypothe-
size the performance of the models on individual
tasks (especially in the same domain) can be im-
proved via joint learning. Speciﬁcally, we compare
three models: the independent single-task model
(BERT), the model reﬁned via MTL (called MT-
BERT-Reﬁnement), and the model ﬁne-tuned for
each task using MT-BERT-Reﬁnement (called MT-
BERT-Fine-Tune). We conduct extensive empirical
studies on the Biomedical Language Understand-
ing Evaluation (BLUE) benchmark (Peng et al.,
2019), which offers a diverse range of text genres
(biomedical and clinical text) and NLP tasks (such
as text similarity, relation extraction, and named
entity recognition). When learned and ﬁne-tuned
on biomedical and clinical domains separately, we
ﬁnd that MTL achieved over 2% performance on
average, created new state-of-the-art results on four
BLUE benchmark tasks. We also demonstrate the
use of multi-task learning to obtain a single model
that still produces state-of-the-art performance on
all tasks. This positive answer will be very helpful
in the context that researchers are in the hassle of
choosing a suitable model for new problems where
training resources are limited.
Our contribution in this work is three-fold:
(1) We conduct extensive empirical studies on 8
tasks from a diverse range of text genres. (2) We
arXiv:2005.02799v1  [cs.CL]  6 May 2020
demonstrate that the MTL ﬁne-tuned model (MT-
BERT-Fine-Tune) achieved state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on average and there is still a beneﬁt to
utilizing the MTL reﬁnement model (MT-BERT-
Reﬁnement). Pairwise MTL, where two tasks were
trained jointly, further demonstrates which tasks
can improve or decrease other tasks. (3) We make
codes and pre-trained MT models publicly avail-
able.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
We ﬁrst present related work in Section 2. Then,
we describe the multi-task learning in Section 3,
followed by our experimental setup, results, and
discussion in Section 4. We conclude with future
work in the last section.

Related work
Multi-tasking learning (MTL) aims to improve the
learning of a model for task t by using the knowl-
edge contained in the tasks where all or a sub-
set of tasks are related (Zhang and Yang, 2017).
It has long been studied and has applications on
neural networks in the natural language process-
ing domain (Caruana, 1997). Collobert and We-
ston (2008) proposed to jointly learn six tasks
such as part-of-speech tagging and language mod-
eling in a time-decay neural network. Changpinyo
et al. (2018) summarized recent studies on apply-
ing MTL in sequence tagging tasks. Bingel and
Søgaard (2017) and Mart´ınez Alonso and Plank
(2017) focused on conditions under which MTL
leads to gain in NLP, and suggest that certain data
features such as learning curve and entropy distri-
bution are probably better predictors of MTL gains.
In the biomedical and clinical domains, MTL
has been studied mostly in two directions. One is
to apply MTL on a single task with multiple cor-
pora. For example, many studies focused on named
entity recognition (NER) tasks (Crichton et al.,
2017; Wang et al., 2019a,b). Zhang et al. (2018),
Khan et al. (2020), and Mehmood et al. (2019) in-
tegrated MTL in the transformer-based networks
(BERT), which is the state-of-the-art language rep-
resentation model and demonstrated promising re-
sults to extract biomedical entities from literature.
Yang et al. (2019) extracted clinical named entity
from Electronic Medical Records using LSTM-
CRF based model. Besides NER, Li et al. (2018)
and Li and Ji (2019) proposed to use MTL on re-
lation classiﬁcation task and Du et al. (2017) on
biomedical semantic indexing. Xing et al. (2018)
exploited domain-invariant knowledge to segment
Chinese word in medical text.
The other direction is to apply MTL on differ-
ent tasks, but the annotations are from a single
corpus. Li et al. (2017) proposed a joint model
extract biomedical entities as well as their relations
simultaneously and carried out experiments on ei-
ther the adverse drug event corpus (Gurulingappa
et al., 2012) or the bacteria biotope corpus (Del´eger
et al., 2016). Shi et al. (2019) also jointly extract
entities and relations but focused on the BioCre-
ative/OHNLP 2018 challenge regarding family his-
tory extraction (Liu et al., 2018). Xue et al. (2019)
integrated the BERT language model into joint
learning through dynamic range attention mech-
anism and ﬁne-tuned NER and relation extraction
tasks jointly on one in-house dataset of coronary
arteriography reports.
Different from these works, we studied to jointly
learn 8 different corpora from 4 different types of
tasks. While MTL has brought signiﬁcant improve-
ments in medicine tasks, no (or mixed) results have
been reported when pre-training MTL models in
different tasks on different corpora. To this end,
we deem that our model can provide more insights
about conditions under which MTL leads to gains
in BioNLP and clinical NLP, and sheds light on the
speciﬁc task relations that can lead to gains from
MTL models over single-task setups.

Multi-task model
The architecture of the MT-BERT model is shown
in Figure 1.
The shared layers are based on
BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). The input X can be
either a sentence or a pair of sentences packed to-
gether by a special token [SEP]. If X is longer
than the allowed maximum length (e.g., 128 tokens
in the BERT’s base conﬁguration), we truncate
X to the maximum length. When X is packed
by a sequence pair, we truncate the longer se-
quence one token at a time. Similar to (Devlin
et al., 2018), two additional tokens are added at the
start ([CLS]) and end ([SEP]) of X, respectively.
Similar to (Lee et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2019), in
the sequence tagging tasks, we split one sentence
into several sub-sentences if it is longer than 30
words.
In the shared layers, the BERT model ﬁrst con-
verts the input sequence to a sequence of embed-
ding vectors. Then, it applies attention mecha-
nisms to gather contextual information. This se-

mantic representation is shared across all tasks and
is trained by our multi-task objectives. Finally, the
BERT model encodes that information in a vector
for each token (h0, . . . , hn).
On top of the shared BERT layers, the task-
speciﬁc layer uses a fully-connected layer for each
task. We ﬁne-tune the BERT model and the task-
speciﬁc layers using multi-task objectives during
the training phase. More details of the multi-task
objectives in the BLUE benchmark are described
below.
3.1
Sentence similarity
Suppose that h0 is the BERT’s output of the to-
ken [CLS] in the input sentence pair (X1, X2).
We use a fully connected layer to compute the
similarity score sim(X1, X2) = ah0 + b, where
sim(X1, X2) is a real value. This task is trained
using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss: (y −
sim(X1, X2))2, where y is the real-value similar-
ity score of the sentence pair.
3.2
Relation extraction
This task extracts binary relations (two arguments)
from sentences. After replacing two arguments
of interest in the sentence with pre-deﬁned tags
(e.g., GENE, or DRUG), this task can be treated
as a classiﬁcation problem of a single sentence
X. Suppose that h0 is the output embedding of
the token [CLS], the probability that a relation
is labeled as class c is predicted by a fully con-
nected layer and a logistic regression with softmax:
P(c|X) = softmax(ah0 + b). This approach is
widely used in the transformer-based models (De-
vlin et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019c).
This task is trained using the categorical cross-
entropy loss: −P
c δ(yc = ˆy) log(P(c|X)), where
δ(yc = ˆy) = 1 if the classiﬁcation ˆy of X is the
correct ground-truth for the class c ∈C; otherwise
δ(yc = ˆy) = 0.
3.3
Inference
After packing the pair of premise sentences with
hypothesis into one sequence, this task can also
be treated as a single sentence classiﬁcation prob-
lem. The aim is to ﬁnd logical relation R between
premise P and hypothesis H. Suppose that that
h0 is the output embedding of the token [CLS] in
X = P ⊕H, P(R|P ⊕H) = softmax(ah0 + b).
This task is trained using the categorical cross-
entropy loss as above.
3.4
Named entity recognition
The output of the BERT model produces a fea-
ture vector sequence {hi}n
i=0 with the same length
as the input sequence X. The MTL model pre-
dicts the label sequence by using a softmax out-
put layer, which scales the output for a label
l ∈{1, 2, . . . , L} as follows: P(ˆyi = j|x) =
exp(hiWj)
PL
l=1 exp(hiWj), where L is the total number of
tags. This task is trained using the categorical cross-
entropy loss: −P
i
P
yi δ(yi = ˆyi) log P(yi|X).
3.5
The training procedure
The training procedure for MT-BERT consists of
three stages: (1) pretraining the BERT model,
(2) reﬁning it via multi-task learning (MT-BERT-
Reﬁnement), and (3) ﬁne-tuning the model using
the task-speciﬁc data (MT-BERT-Fine-Tune).
3.5.1
Pretraining
The pretraining stage follows that of the BERT us-
ing the masked language modeling technique (De-
vlin et al., 2018). Here we used the base version.
The maximum length of the input sequences is thus
128.
3.5.2
Reﬁning via Multi-task learning
In this step, we reﬁne all layers in the model. Al-
gorithm 1 demonstrates the process of multi-task
learning (Liu et al., 2019c). We ﬁrst initialize the
shared layers with the pre-trained BERT model
and randomly initialize the task-speciﬁc layer pa-
rameters. Then we create the dataset by merging
mini-batches of all the datasets. In each epoch, we
randomly select a mini-batch bt of task t from all
datasets D. Then we update the model according
to the task-speciﬁc objective of the task t. Same as
in (Liu et al., 2019c), we use the mini-batch based
stochastic gradient descent to learn the parameters.

for bt in D do
Compute loss: L(θ) based on task t;
Compute gradient: ∇(θ)
Update model: θ = θ −η∇(θ)
end
end
3.5.3
Fine-tuning MT-BERT
We ﬁne-tune existing MT-BERT that are trained in
the previous stage by continue training all layers
on each speciﬁc task. Provided that the dataset is
not drastically different in context to other datasets,
the MT-BERT model will already have learned gen-
eral features that are relevant to a speciﬁc problem.
Speciﬁcally, we truncate the last layer (softmax and
linear layers) of the MT-BERT and replace it with
a new one, then we use a smaller learning rate to
train the network.
4
Experiments
We evaluate the proposed MT-BERT on 8 tasks in
BLUE benchmarks. We compare three types of
models: (1) existing start-of-the-art BERT models
ﬁne-tuned directly on each task, respectively; (2)
reﬁnement MT-BERT with multi-task training (MT-
BERT-Reﬁnement); and (3) MT-BERT with ﬁne-
tuning (MT-BERT-Fine-Tune).
4.1
Datasets
We evaluate the performance of the models on 8
datasets in the BLUE benchmark used by (Peng
et al., 2019). Table 1 gives a summary of these
datasets. Brieﬂy, ClinicalSTS is a corpus of sen-
tence pairs selected from Mayo Clinics’s clinical
data warehouse (Wang et al., 2018). The i2b2 2010
dataset was collected from three different hospi-
tals and was annotated by medical practitioners for
eight types of relations between problems and treat-
ments (Uzuner et al., 2011). MedNLI is a collection
of sentence pairs selected from MIMIC-III (Shiv-
ade, 2017). For a fair comparison, we use the same
training, development and test sets to train and eval-
uate the models. ShARe/CLEF is a collection of
299 de-identiﬁed clinical free-text notes from the
MIMIC-II database (Suominen et al., 2013). This
corpus is for disease entity recognition.
In the biomedical domain, the ChemProt con-
sists of 1,820 PubMed abstracts with chemical-
protein interactions (Krallinger et al., 2017). The
DDI corpus is a collection of 792 texts selected
from the DrugBank database and other 233 Med-
line abstracts (Herrero-Zazo et al., 2013). These
two datasets were used in the relation extraction
task for various types of relations. BC5CDR is
a collection of 1,500 PubMed titles and abstracts
selected from the CTD-Pﬁzer corpus and was used
in the named entity recognition task for chemical
and disease entities (Li et al., 2016).
4.2
Training
Our implementation of MT-BERT is based on
the work of (Liu et al., 2019c).1
We trained
the model on one NVIDIA R⃝V100 GPU using
the PyTorch framework. We used the Adamax
optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with a learn-
ing rate of 5e−5, a batch size of 32, a linear

0.1, and a weight decay of 0.01 applied to every
epoch of training by following (Liu et al., 2019c).
We use the BioBERT (Lee et al., 2020), Blue-
BERT base model (Peng et al., 2019), and Clin-
icalBERT (Alsentzer et al., 2019) as the domain-
speciﬁc language model2. As a result, all the to-
kenized texts using wordpieces were chopped to
spans no longer than 128 tokens. We set the max-
imum number of epochs to 100. We also set the
dropout rate of all the task-speciﬁc layers as 0.1. To
avoid the exploding gradient problem, we clipped
the gradient norm within 1. To ﬁne-tune the MT-
BERT on speciﬁc tasks, we set the maximum num-
ber of epochs to 10 and learning rate e−5.

Results
One of the most important criteria of building prac-
tical systems is fast adaptation to new domains.
To evaluate the models on different domains, we
multi-task learned various MT-BERT on BLUE
2https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/bluebert
biomedical tasks and clinical tasks, respectively.
BlueBERTclinical is the base BlueBERT model
pretrained on PubMed abstracts and MIMIC-III
clinical notes, and ﬁne-tuned for each BLUE task
on task-speciﬁc data.
MT- model are the pro-
posed models described in Section 3. We used
the pre-trained BlueBERTclinical to initialize its
shared layers, reﬁned the model via MTL on the
BLUE tasks (MT-BlueBERT-Reﬁnementclinical).
We keep ﬁne-tuning the model for each BLUE task
using task-speciﬁc data, then got MT-BlueBERT-
Fine-Tuneclinical.
Table 2 shows the results on clinical tasks. MT-
BlueBERT-Fine-Tuneclinical created new state-of-
the-art results on 2 tasks and pushing the bench-
mark to 81.9%, which amounts to 1.3% abso-
lution improvement over BlueBERTclinical and
1.2% absolute improvement over MT-BlueBERT-
Reﬁnementclinical. On the ShAReCLEFE task, the
model gained the largest improvement by 6%. On
the MedNLI task, the MT model gained improve-
ment by 2.4%. On the remaining tasks, the MT

of-the-art performance with less than 1% differ-
ences. When compared the models with and with-
out ﬁne-tuning on single datasets, Table 2 shows
that the multi-task reﬁnement model is similar to
single baselines on average. Consider that MT-
BlueBERT-Reﬁnementclinical is one model while
BlueBERTclinical are 4 individual models, we be-
lieve the MT reﬁnement model would bring the ben-
eﬁt when researchers are in the hassle of choosing
the suitable model for new problems or problems
with limited training data.

on 2 tasks and pushing the benchmark to 83.6%,
which amounts to 2.0% absolute improvement over
BlueBERTbiomedical and 2.1% absolute improve-
ment over MT-BlueBERT-Reﬁnementbiomedical.
On the DDI task, the model gained the largest
improvement by 8.1%.

Discussion
4.4.1
Pairwise MTL
To investigate which tasks are beneﬁcial or harm-
ful to others, we train on two tasks jointly us-
ing MT-BlueBERT-Reﬁnementbiomedical and MT-
BlueBERT-Reﬁnementclinical. Figure 2 gives pair-
wise relationships. The directed green (or red and
grey) edge from s to t means s improves (or de-
creases and has no effect on) t.
In the clinical tasks, ShARe/CLEFE always gets
beneﬁts from multi-task learning the remaining 3
tasks as the incoming edges are green. One fac-
tor might be that ShARe/CLEFE is an NER task
that generally requires more training data to fulﬁll
the data-hungry need of the BERT model. Clini-

calSTS helps MedNLI because the nature of both
are related and their inputs are a pair of sentences.
MedNLI can help other tasks except ClinicalSTS
partially because the test set of ClinialSTS is too
small to reﬂect the changes. We also note that i2b2
2010 re can be both beneﬁcial and harmful, depend-
ing on which other tasks they are trained with. One
potential cause is i2b2 2010 re was collected from
three different hospitals and have the largest label
size of 8.
In the biomedical tasks, both DDI and ChemProt
tasks can be improved by MTL on other tasks, po-
tentially because they are harder with largest size of
label thus require more training data. In the mean-
while, BC5CDR chemical and disease can barely
be improved potentially because they have already
got large dataset to ﬁt the model.
4.4.2
MTL on BERT variants
First, we would like to compare multi-task
learning on BERT variants: BioBERT, Clinical-
BERT, and BlueBERT. In the clinical tasks (Ta-
ble 4), MT-BlueBERT-Fine-Tuneclinical outper-
forms other models on all tasks. When compared
the MTL models using BERT model pretrained on
PubMed only (rows 2 and 3) and on the combina-
tion of PubMed and clinical notes (row 4), it shows
the impact of using clinical notes during the pre-
training process. This observation is consistently
as shown in (Peng et al., 2019). On the other hand,
MT-ClinicalBERT-Fine-Tune, which used Clinical-
BERT during the pretraining, drops ∼1.6% across
the tasks. The differences between ClinicalBERT
and BlueBERT are at least in 2-fold. (1) Clini-
calBERT used “cased” text while BlueBERT used
“uncased” text; and (2) the number of epochs to con-
tinuously pretrained the model. Given that there are
limited details of pretraining ClinicalBERT, further
investigation may be necessary.
In the biomedical tasks, Table 5 shows that
MT-BioBERT-Fine-Tune and MT-BlueBERT-Fine-
Tunebiomedical reached comparable results and pre-
training on clinical notes has a negligible impact.

Results on all BLUE tasks
Next, we also compare MT-BERT with its vari-
ants on all BLUE tasks. Table 6 shows that MT-
BioBERT-Fine-Tune reached the best performance
on average and MT-BlueBERT-Fine-Tunebiomedical
stays closely. While confusing results were ob-
tained when combing variety of tasks in both
biomedical and clinical domains, we observed
again that MTL models pretrained on biomedical
literature perform better in biomedical tasks; and
MTL models pretrained on both biomedical liter-
ature and clinical notes perform better in clinical
tasks. These observations may suggest that it might
be helpful to train separate deep neural networks
on different types of text genres in BioNLP.

Conclusions and future work
In this work, we conduct an empirical study on
MTL for biomedical and clinical tasks, which so
far has been mostly studied with one or two tasks.
Our results provide insights regarding domain adap-
tation and show beneﬁts of the MTL reﬁnement
and ﬁne-tuning. We recommend a combination of
the MTL reﬁnement and task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning
approach based on the evaluation results. When
learned and ﬁne-tuned on a different domain, MT-
BERT achieved improvements by 2.0% and 1.3%
in biomedical and clinical domains, respectively.
Speciﬁcally, it has brought signiﬁcant improve-
ments in 4 tasks.
There are two limitations to this work. First, our
results on MTL training across all BLUE bench-
mark show that MTL is not always effective. We
are interested in exploring further the character-
ization of task relationships. For example, it is
not clear whether there are data characteristics that
help to determine its success (Mart´ınez Alonso and
Plank, 2017; Changpinyo et al., 2018). In addi-
tion, our results suggest that the model could ben-
eﬁt more from some speciﬁc examples of some
of the tasks in Table 1. For example, it might
be of interest to not using the BC5CDR corpus
in the relation extraction task in future. Second,
we studied one approach to MTL by sharing the
encoder between all tasks while keeping several
task-speciﬁc decoders. Other approaches, such as
ﬁne-tuning only the task speciﬁc layers, soft pa-
rameter sharing (Ruder, 2017), knowledge distilla-
tion (Liu et al., 2019b), need to be investigated in
the future.
While our work only scratches the surface of
MTL in the medical domain, we hope it will shed
light on the development of generalizable NLP
models and task relations that can lead to gains
from MTL models over single-task setups.
