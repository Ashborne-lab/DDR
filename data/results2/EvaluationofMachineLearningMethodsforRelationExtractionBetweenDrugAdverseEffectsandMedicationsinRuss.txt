Abstract
The research considers an automatic extraction of relations between
mentions of medications and adverse drug reactions in Russian-
language drug reviews. This text analyzing method might be useful
for pharmacovigilance and medicines reprofiling. Its application to
Russian-language reviews hasn't been studied yet due to the lack of
corpora with relation annotation in Russian.
The study is aimed at solving this problem. It is based on the
original dataset gathered by our group. It consists of annotated
relations between entities from the Russian Drug Review Corpus,
that contains the Internet users' reviews on medications in Russian
language. Computational experiments were carried out on
developed corpora using classical machine learning methods, as
well as a more advanced neural network model based on
Transformer layers -- XLM-RoBERTa-sag. The list of applied
classical machine learning methods consists of support vector
machine, logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifier and gradient
boosting. The concatenation of TF-IDF entity vectors of character n-
grams was used as a text representation. Based on a set of
experiments, the following hyperparameters of these methods were
selected: the size of n-grams and the limitation on the frequency of
occurrence of n-grams (too rare or too frequent n-grams were
excluded from the feature vector). For XLM-RoBERTa-sag, the input
data is represented as usual for such type of models (language
models based on Transformer topology). The following input text
representation types were considered during the experiments: a
whole text, a text of target entity pairs; a text of target entity pairs
with words between them; a text of target entity pairs and the
whole input text, the latter input type is the one that maximizes
accuracy. It is shown that XLM-RoBERTa-sag model achieves a
result of 95%, according to the macro-averaged f1 metric, which is
the state-of-the-art result of recognition of the relations between
mentions of adverse drug reactions and medications in Russian-
language online reviews. The Naive Bayes classifier with
multivariate normal distribution achieves the best result among
classical machine learning methods: 75%, which exceeds the result
of random label generation by 21%.
