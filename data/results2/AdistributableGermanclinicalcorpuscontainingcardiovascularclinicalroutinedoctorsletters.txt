We present CARDIO:DE, the first freely available and distributable large German clinical corpus from 
the cardiovascular domain. CARDIO:DE encompasses 500 clinical routine German doctor’s letters from 
Heidelberg University Hospital, which were manually annotated. Our prospective study design complies 
well with current data protection regulations and allows us to keep the original structure of clinical 
documents consistent. In order to ease access to our corpus, we manually de-identified all letters. To 
enable various information extraction tasks the temporal information in the documents was preserved. 
We added two high-quality manual annotation layers to CARDIO:DE, (1) medication information and 
(2) CDA-compliant section classes. To the best of our knowledge, CARDIO:DE is the first freely available 
and distributable German clinical corpus in the cardiovascular domain. In summary, our corpus offers 
unique opportunities for collaborative and reproducible research on natural language processing 
models for German clinical texts.
Background & Summary
Despite sustained declines in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in many countries across Europe, CVDs 
still account for approx. 4.1 million deaths within European Society of Cardiology (ESC) member countries and 
have remained the most common cause of death within this region (45 and 39% of all deaths in females and 
males, respectively). Moreover, the prevalence of CVDs across Europe is still high with an estimated 113 million 
people living with CVD in the 57 ESC member countries, significantly contributing to patient morbidity and 
hospitalizations1.
At the same time, in clinical routine, large portions of data like patient anamnesis, cardiovascular risk factors 
and diagnosis continue to be stored in unstructured form, such as free text in doctor’s letters2. The predominantly 
hypothesis-driven strategies used in cardiovascular research should be complemented by computer-assisted 
methods. The comprehensive analyses of large clinical datasets using automatic information extraction methods 
will not only significantly expand the data sources for clinical care and research, but could also improve clinical 
decision-making and enable progress in personalized medicine2.
The rapid development in the field of natural language processing (NLP) in the past 15 years provided power-
ful tools for automatic text processing3. A high number of models, based on rule-based methods, statistical and 
more recently neural network methods were developed and validated for various tasks. While state-of-the-art 
(SOTA) supervised machine learning models require annotated data for training, all methods require annotated 
data for evaluation and quality control.
Therefore, shared corpora in the clinical domain are essential to support transparent and reproducible exper-
iments and foster innovation in the field of clinical NLP2,4,5. In addition to their use for various medical informa-
tion extraction tasks, e.g. they can be used for (1) training unsupervised or semi-supervised machine learning 
models, (2) the development of clustering or topic modelling methods6, (3) the development of pre-processing

methods such as sentence-splitting, tokenization or part-of-speech tagging7, (4) domain adaptation of language 
models through pre-training techniques8, (5) the development of data augmentation techniques to overcome 
data scarcity9 or (6) use of the corpus as a reference corpus for collaborative cross-site clinical annotation 
projects.
Progress In clinical NLP can have a direct impact on clinical routine, as it enables clinicians to extract insights 
from large amounts of clinical textual data. For example: (1) to build clinical decision support systems that can 
be used to identify drug-drug interactions or adverse drug events or (2) to support clinical trial recruitment, by 
identifying patients based on their clinical anamnesis, diagnosis or demographics.
State of research. 
Although the availability of textual data from medical domain has increased, there is still 
an immense need for high quality, but also freely accessible clinical text corpora. Particularly strict data protection 
regulations are a huge challenge that prevent publishing even small-scale data sets. Distributable English medical 
corpora in the U.S. must meet the regulations of the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
of 1996; https://www.hipaajournal.com/de-identification-protected-health-information/). Accordingly, the safe 
harbor section explicitly lists eighteen Protected Health Information (PHI) identifiers (e.g. person names, dates 
etc.), which need to be removed from a clinical document in order to define it as de-identified (https://www.hhs.
gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html, accessed 10.09.2022).
Based on HIPAA several clinical text corpora in English were recently published. The MIMIC III (Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care) corpus10 is one of the most popular and largest data set. MIMIC III con-
tains approximately 2 million free text notes from various clinical domains. In addition, annotated clinical cor-
pora are published in context of shared tasks11, e.g. by the i2b2 foundation (>805,118 tokens, https://portal.
dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp), CLEF (http://clef-ehealth.org/), SemEval (http://alt.qcri.org/seme-
val2014/) and THYME12. The availability of these corpora led to a series of developments of information extrac-
tion frameworks in clinical setting13.
In contrast to the US HIPAA regulation, European data protection regulations, specifically the GDPR 
(General Data Protection Regulation), do not explicitly define how to de-identify a clinical document 
when sharing it (For a more detailed comparison between GDPR and HIPAA, see: https://iapp.org/news/a/
gdpr-match-up-the-health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act/, accessed 10.09.2022). However, lately, 
non-English European corpora were published under the GDPR, e.g. (1) MERLOT, a French clinical routine 
corpus containing 500 manually de-identified documents including 148,476 tokens14 or (2) IULA, a Spanish 
clinical record corpus, containing de-identified and shuffled sentences extracted from 300 clinical reports15. 
Unfortunately, to date there are only a handful of German medical corpora publicly available. This led to the devel-
opment of German medical corpora containing medical guidelines or synthetically generated clinical texts11,16–19. 
The largest German medical corpus is currently GGPONC 2.0, containing approximately 1,8 million tokens, 
which builds upon clinical guidelines from the oncology domain11.
The only distributable German clinical routine corpus available contains 200 oncological discharge summa-
ries (89,942 tokens, created between 2013–2016) from the university hospitals Berlin (Charité) and Tübingen20. 
As these data were collected retrospectively, each document needed to be carefully manually de-identified. 
Furthermore, all sentences in the corpus were shuffled in order to meet legal requirements of the clinical data 
protection officers and the ethics committee. Thus, only sentence-level medical information extraction (MIE) 
is possible requiring proper sentence segmentations, which is quite challenging in clinical texts. To the best of 
our knowledge, CARDIO:DE is the first freely available and distributable German corpus containing coherent 
documents from the cardiovascular clinical routine.
Goals. 
The goal of CARDIO:DE is to foster NLP research in the German-speaking cardiovascular domain by 
publishing a freely available corpus containing cardiovascular doctor’s letters from clinical routine. To achieve 
this goal, we prospectively collected 500 doctor’s letters from the cardiology department at Heidelberg University 
Hospital. In addition, we publish two manually annotated layers:
	 1.	 for medication information extraction and
	 2.	 for section classification.
Furthermore, we present results of various baseline classifiers, trained and evaluated on both annotation 
layers.
Corpus characteristics. 
CARDIO:DE encompasses 500 cardiovascular doctor’s letters covering a broad clin-
ical spectrum of a tertiary care cardiovascular centre between 2020 and 2021. Our corpus covers 311 in-patient, 
172 out-patient and 17 letters of the cardiac emergency room (chest pain unit; CPU). Thus, the included doctor’s 
letters cover both complex multiple-day hospitalizations as well as brief out-patient presentations. This results 
in the deployment of a representative collection of clinical documents, covering common doctor’s letter sec-
tions (e.g. anamnesis, physical examination, instrumental diagnostics, laboratory results, epicrisis, medication) 
in varying degrees and details. Figure 1 illustrates an excerpt of a doctor’s letter including common section types. 
The complete corpus contains 993,143 tokens, with approximately 31,952 unique tokens.
We randomly split our corpus into two parts (similar to Kittner et al., 202120). CARDIO:DE400 contains 400 
documents, 805,617 tokens and 114,348 annotations. CARDIO:DE100 contains 100 documents, 187,526 tokens 
and 26,784 annotations. Both corpora will be published for scientific research purposes. Scientific research 
excludes processing the data for marketing purposes. We will only publish annotations of CARDIO:DE400, 
annotations of CARDIO:DE100 will be kept inhouse as held-out data for a shared task on various MIE tasks, 
which we want to organize in the future.

a box plot for the whole CARDIO:DE corpus. In Table 2 we present the most common 50 whitespace separated 
token in CARDIO:DE including token count.
We aim to publish cardiovascular doctor’s letters as close as possible to clinical routine documents. To achieve 
this, CARDIO:DE is based on a prospective study design with patient consent, which enabled us to keep the 
original document structure of clinical routine doctor’s letters (Fig. 3). While collecting patient consents can be 
time consuming and tedious, this procedure assures us to best comply with current data protection regulations in 
Germany. Moreover, similarly to recent corpus distribution projects10,20 we preserved the information on patient’s 
age and time/date in the documents. Thus, the corpus can be used for various information extraction tasks on 
document level in the cardiovascular domain. In a future version of CARDIO:DE, to further increase corpus 
consistency, all PHI placeholders will be replaced by semantic related surrogates, as proposed in Lohr et al., 202121.

Methods
Ethics declarations. 
This study has been approved by the ethics committee of the Heidelberg University 
Hospital (S-498/2020) and has therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in 
the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. All persons gave their informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. 
The manuscript does not contain clinical studies or patient data.
Data selection and collection. 
This study was designed monocentric, non-interventional, non-randomized, and 
prospective by collecting 500 patient consents between 2020 and 2021 in the cardiology department at the Heidelberg 
University Hospital. One doctor’s letter per patient was included into the CARDIO:DE corpus. Inclusion criteria were 
as follows: (1) age of at least 18 years (2) written consent signed by the patient; and (3) a diagnosis with a cardiovascular 
system disease. Patients were included after revision of the criteria by the recruiting study assistant, adequate informa-
tion and subsequent signing of the CARDIO:DE consent form. By signing, the patient’s next generated doctor’s letter 
was included into the corpus. No study-specific additional examinations or further measures are performed within the 
scope of the project; thus the patient was not exposed to any additional risk.
We then exported each document and converted it from binary MS doc to MS docx to a plain text format 
(LibreOffice 6.1.5.2, https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Faq/General/150, accessed: 22.08.2022) keeping the 
paragraph sections consistent, highlighted with the “¶” symbol in MS Word. We split each document by para-
graph and tokenized each document using spaCy (v.3.2.1, language pipeline: de_dep_news_trf)22.
De-Identification. 
All documents were initially de-identified using a deep learning model trained on man-
ually annotated in-house data23. The model was trained on a pre-defined set of PHI classes. In a second step, clin-
ical experts manually reviewed the automatic de-identified documents and replaced remaining un-deidentified 
PHI token with appropriate semantic placeholders. To keep the chronological order in the documents, we fol-
lowed best-practice procedures10 by shifting all dates by a random number per document. Information about 
weekdays, time of day and seasons were kept. We also kept the information about patient age in the documents. If 
the patient was older than 80 years, we followed best-practice approaches10, by shifting age by a random number 
larger than 300.
We added three initial lines to each document containing pseudonymized meta information about: 
(1) admission date, (2) date of birth and (3) patient age. To further ensure anonymity, we removed outliers in 
laboratory values of each document, including patient height and weight. To identify outliers, we used a z-score 
approach24. Finally, we stored each doctor’s letter in our clinical data storage to save the corpus for further data 
preparation and annotation.
Data annotation. 
We created two annotation layers to CARDIO:DE: (1) medication information on 
token-level and (2) information of section type on paragraph level. We used the annotation tool INCEpTION 
(v. 22.3) optimized for span annotations, including a monitoring and curation tool25. INCEpTION was installed

as a web service in the clinical network to facilitate its use and data access for our annotation task force inside the 
clinical infrastructure.
Annotation workflow. 
We used well-established annotation methods26–29, including a guideline adaptation 
process by redundantly annotating documents involving an inter-annotator agreement score (IAA) in an iterative 
approach (Fig. 4).
After drafting initial guidelines with domain experts, a subset of documents was sampled from the main 
corpus for redundant annotation by all annotators. After each iteration the annotation master reviewed all anno-
tations and documented all disagreements. To measure annotation quality an IAA score was calculated. During 
the following review meeting with all annotating participants including the annotation master all disagreements 
were discussed and a joint solution was defined. If necessary, the guidelines were adapted and a new iteration 
round was initialized until a pre-defined IAA threshold was met, depending on the annotation task. The annota-
tion master curated all documents of each iteration based on the adapted guidelines. After redundant annotation 
was completed each annotator was assigned to a distinct subset of the remaining documents. To ensure high 
annotation quality nevertheless, the annotation master carefully reviewed all single annotated documents in 
compliance with the final guidelines.
Medication information annotation. 
Our medication information annotation scheme is based on 
Uzuner et al., 201030, and was adapted to the specific structure of our CARDIO:DE data (guidelines available as 
Supplementary File 1). As we performed a named entity recognition (NER) task, with many tokens not getting 
annotated with a class type, we used F1-score (harmonic mean between precision and recall) as IAA. We per-
formed three iterations for redundant annotation with six annotators (four medical informatics master’s students, 
three with clinical experience and two medical students in their seventh semester (third clinical semester) with 
clinical routine experience) containing 15, 15 and 10 documents. The entire project lifetime, including prepara-
tion, annotation and evaluation, was three months. Approximate annotation time per document was 5–10 min.
Most of medication information in a doctor’s letter is listed in a separate semi-structured section 
(e.g. Therapieempfehlung, Medikation bei Aufnahme, …). In addition, we annotated medication information 
in narrative text sections. For all annotated medications in a doctor’s letter, the patient had to be the experi-
encer. We neither made any assumptions nor considered longitudinal information from external sources about 
a patient.
Our annotation objective was to identify a relevant drug (Drug) or active ingredient (ActiveIng) and its 
relation information (Dosage, Route, Frequency, Duration, Strength, Reason and Form). Moreover, we added 
a binary attribute (inNarrative) to each Drug/ActiveIng, to mark whether the medication information is in a 
semi-structured or in a plain text section (Fig. 5).
In this initial corpus version, we did not add entity normalization to the medication information layer.
Section type annotation. 
Our section type annotation scheme is based on Lohr et al., 201831, but is more 
coarse-grained and carried out on paragraph-level (guidelines available as Supplementary File 2). To measure 
the quality of annotations we calculated an IAA using Krippendorff’s alpha. Krippendorff’s alpha is a chance 
corrected inter-annotator agreement score and can be used for any number of annotators and class labels32. 
We performed three iterations for redundant annotation with three annotators (two clinical data scientists 
Fig. 4  Annotation workflow. Iterative guideline adaptation process used for CARDIO:DE annotation layers. 
Redundant iterations helped synchronize the annotations with the guidelines. After meeting the IAA threshold, 
a final batch was assigned to each annotator.

researching on clinical routine documents at the cardiology department, one research student assistant studying 
computational linguistics (B.A.) in sixth semester) containing 35, 30 and 20 documents. The project lifetime, 
including preparation, annotation and evaluation, was two months. Approximate annotation time per document 
was 3–8 min.
We annotated fourteen section types. Nine section types are mapped to HL7 CDA elements (Arztbrief Plus, 
v. 3.15, https://wiki.hl7.de/index.php?title=IG:Arztbrief_Plus, accessed 06.10.2022). Sections related to diagno-
sis are not mapped to CDA elements. The CDA standard separates diagnosis sections into Entlassungsdiagnose 
(discharge diagnosis) and Aufnahmediagnose (admission diagnosis). Neither of them is explicitly part of doctor’s 
letters in CARDIO:DE. After consultation with cardiologists, we decided to use the most representative head-
ing names in the original doctor’s letters as section class labels. There are typically two section headings related 
to diagnosis: (1) AktuellDiagnosen: This section contains discharge diagnosis information and is part of most 
of the letters. (2) Diagnosen: This section type contains admission or discharge diagnosis information. In the 
original documents in MS word format, important diagnosis information is commonly written as bold type. 
This information is not part of the documents in CARDIO:DE. After consultation with physicians, in addition 
to CDA section type Befunde, we annotated section types KUBefunde and EchoBefunde. Both appear frequently 
in CARDIO:DE letters and are considered relevant for cardiovascular clinical routine and research. Sections and 
paragraphs which cannot be mapped to one of the thirteen section types listed in Table 3 are annotated with the 
generic section type Mix.
CARDIO:DE contains high-quality gold standard annotations for medication information and CDA 
compliant section types. Our IAA scores are comparable to previously published similar annotation projects 
(e.g. IAA from i2b2 corpus for medication information on token-level F1: 81.6–88%33, e.g. IAA for section types, 
median Krippendorff alpha: for seven classes: 84.6, 11–21 classes: 70–84.431. Please note, that these IAAs are not 
completely comparable, due to different pre-processing steps and measurement procedures). Since the corpus is 
freely available for research purposes, excluding marketing purposes, we encourage the community to improve 
existing annotations and add new annotation layers to CARDIO:DE. Indeed, we think of CARDIO:DE as a facil-
itator and driver of collaborative NLP research in the German-speaking cardiovascular community. To support 
this goal, we also plan to organize shared tasks for various clinical NLP topics, such as concept normalization or 
negation detection. We will also be releasing new and updated annotation layers.
Fig. 5  Example annotation for medication information. This annotated text snippet includes medication 
information annotations and relations to other tokens. The ActiveIng entity contains an attribute inNarrative to 
specify if the entity is inside a semi-structured section (−) or plain text section (+) of a doctor’s letter. In this 
example, the ActiveIng entity is inside a semi-structured section.

Data Records
We publish CARDIO:DE for scientific research purposes and follow best-practice approaches of recently published 
clinical data sets10,20. Scientific research excludes processing the data for marketing purposes. The corpus con-
tains detailed clinical care data of patients. In this context, CARDIO:DE needs to be used with care and respect10. 
We distribute the data via heiDATA (https://heidata.uni-heidelberg.de/). The corpus must be formally requested 
following instructions on the CARDIO:DE website in the Terms of Use section (https://doi.org/10.11588/data/
AFYQDY)34. This procedure also applies for the CARDIO:DE_EXP corpus, which includes additional experi-
mental annotation layers (details, see Usage Notes section)34.
CARDIO:DE (cardiode.zip) contains 500 doctor’s letters in plain text and in tsv3 format (WebAnno 
TSV version 3.3). The corpus is published as a zip file, containing all data files distributed in two folders 
(CARDIODE400_main, CARDIODE100_heldout). The tsv3 files of the CARDIO:DE400 split contain 
the untokenized and the tokenized format including annotations for the medication information and the section 
information layers. The tsv3 files of the distributed CARDIO:DE100 split only contain the untokenized and the 
tokenized format of each letter (Fig. 6).
CARDIO:DE_EXP (cardiode_exp.zip) is published with the same folder and file structure as CARDIO:DE. 
In addition to all annotations of CARDIO:DE, it contains three experimental medication information entity 
annotations: Reason, Route and Dosage.
Technical Validation
Annotation quality. 
Medication information.  Figure 7 shows all token level median IAA scores of all anno-
tator combinations per iteration per medication information class. Detailed information of IAA scores including 
standard deviation, see Table 4.
IAA could be improved consistently for three classes (Drug, Form and Frequency) over all iterations. For 
classes Duration, Strength and Reason IAA could be increased in second iteration and slightly decreased in third 
iteration. The complex Reason class still achieved a relatively low IAA (0.41) in iteration 3. For classes Route and 
ActiveIng IAA continuously decreased over all iterations. Standard deviation decreased in iteration 3 for all but 
the Dosage class, which showed the overall lowest IAA scores with a maximum of 0.33 in iteration 3.
Considering median micro average F1-score, token-wise F1-score could be improved in second iteration 
from 0.85 to 0.89, but only leveled at 0.85 in third iteration. Entity-wise median F1-score decreased in second 
iteration from 0.84 to 0.79, but increased to 0.81 in third iteration, which is 3 percentage points below IAA of 
first iteration (Table 5).
In addition to IAA for token level medication information, we calculated micro average F1-scores to measure 
the annotation quality of the annotations of medication information relation. We could improve IAA in second 
iteration by 0.25. In the last iteration IAA decreased to 0.61 (Table 5). As also reported by other publications, the 
IAA scores for relation annotation were generally lower, than for entity annotations14,28.
Overall, the synchronization of the annotation for medication information was very challenging. While 
annotation quality of medication information in the structured section of doctor’s letters quickly improved, 
annotation of more complex medication information samples in plain text remained difficult. Due to time 
restrictions, we stopped redundant annotations after the third iteration. Moreover, although some IAA scores 
could not be increased or even decreased, IAA scores of the most frequent classes (Drug, ActiveIng, Strength, 
Form, Frequency, Duration) achieved a sufficient quality (0.75–0.98).
One reason for the challenging synchronization might be rooted in the different educational backgrounds 
of the annotators. Generally, medical students and medical informatics students with experiences in clinical 
routine shared higher IAA scores. This was apparent for the Reason class, as this information demanded a more 
profound clinical knowledge. The Dosage class achieved lowest IAA scores as Dosage entities were easily con-
fused as Strength entities (e.g. max Zufuhr von 4 IE Insulin/h: 4 IE repeatedly annotated as Dosage; Torasemid 
Fig. 6  Structure of a CARDIO:DE400 tsv3 file. Excerpt of a tsv file from CARDIO:DE400_main corpus split. 
The header (initial four lines) contains meta information about the file structure: (1) version information,  
(2) medication information layer including attributes ClassType and InNarrative, (3) medication relation layer, 
(4) section information layer including attribute Sectiontypes. After the header each untokenized paragraph 
of the doctor’s letter is introduced by the key #Text. This is followed by a token-wise representation of the 
paragraph. Each line contains seven columns: (1) paragraph number and token number, (2) character offsets, 
(3) token, (4) medication information ClassType, (5) medication attribute InNarrative, (6) medication relation, 
(7) section information attribute Sectiontypes. CARDIO:DE100 tsv3 files do not contain annotation layer 
information in the header. Furthermore, the token-wise representation only contains the first three columns, 
excluding annotations columns. For further general details on the tsv3 format, see: https://inception-project.

5 mg 1-1-0: 5 mg repeatedly annotated as Dosage). In addition, Strength was occasionally annotated as Dosage 
in the structured medication sections. Overall Dosage entities are rarely represented in the corpus; thus, these 
results are not fully representative.
At the end of our annotation iterations, we had to face another challenge. To increase heterogeneity of the 
doctor’s letters in each iteration, we did not just randomly select letters from the complete corpus but restricted 
each sampling for each iteration to a specific time period of patient recruitment. For example; iteration 1 con-
tained the first ten letters from the beginning of the projects recruiting phase, while iteration 2 contained letters 
from the middle of this phase. This resulted in a bias, as the patient recruitment was sometimes dominated by 
in-patients, out-patients or patients from the CPU. The structure of these letters can vary significantly, therefore 
the medication information in each iteration batch varied in its notational form. For future annotation projects, 
we recommend a more balanced distribution of such letters in each iteration in order to improve agreement 
between different iterations.
Due to the not satisfying IAA scores of Reason, Route and Dosage, we excluded these classes from 
CARDIO:DE. Still, to allow further improvement of annotation quality and to further experiment with these

classes we distribute an experimental corpus named CARDIO:DE_EXP including all nine medication informa-
tion classes, medication relations and section classes34.
The final CARDIO:DE corpus contains in total 24,234 annotated medication information entities 
(Table 6) with 15,105 medication relations. The most frequent medication information classes are related to 
ActiveIng/Drug and their relations Frequency and Strength. Corpus statistics of CARDIODE_EXP are shown in 
Table 7. Figure 8 illustrates the most frequently annotated Drug entities in CARDIO:DE.
Section annotation.  We could increase IAA from a Krippendorff’s alpha score of 0.91 to 0.96 (Table 8).
The final corpus contains in total 116,898 annotated paragraphs with section classes. The most frequent sec-
tion class was Labor and Befunde. Befunde is a meta class, containing all kinds of findings, excluding KUBefunde 
and EchoBefunde. Labor contains laboratory information in a flattened tabular format. The least annotations are 
related to the class Anrede. This includes typically a single introductory sentence at the top of a doctor’s letter, 
containing information of the patient and the receiving department (Table 9).
During redundant section annotation, we faced a decrease in IAA in iteration 2. This was mainly due to a 
major change in the annotation scheme. Initially we annotated all lines of a section type with a span annotation. 
This resulted in slow performance of the INCEpTION tool, which made annotations unnecessarily laborious. 
The annotators decided to continue annotating just the first paragraph of a new section type. A new section type 
defines the end of the previous section type. The decision to only annotate the first paragraph of a new section 
type increased annotation speed significantly.
In iteration 2, the annotators missed some section ends because not every line had to be annotated anymore, 
especially with regard to section classes inside the Befunde class. Frequently annotators missed to mark the end 
of a EchoBefunde or AllergienUnverträglichkeitenRisiken section and as a result these sections covered too many 
paragraphs. After thorough review meetings, we were able to overcome this problem in Iteration 3.
Other issues concerned how to define the section type EntlassMedikation. Some doctor’s letters con-
tained two explicit medication sections: section type AufnahmeMedikation at the beginning and section 
type EntlassMedikation at the end. EntlassMedikation was frequently introduced by the header ‘Aktuelle 
Medikation’. But a couple of letters only contained a single medication section at the beginning of a document. 
Therefore, some annotators interpreted these sections as AufnahmeMedikation, even though it is introduced 
with the header ‘Aktuelle Medikation’. After review meetings and consultations with physicians, we defined this 
initial medication section with this header as EntlassMedikation in the guidelines.

Data approval will require at least one week. The data request needs to contain the following information:
	(1)	 A signed DUA, signed by each data user individually.
	(2)	 A group description including the requestor’s (data user’s) name, affiliation, position and email address and 
website of the institution.
	(3)	 A project description of the research purpose (max. 150 words).
	(4)	 Name, affiliation, position, email address and signature of the responsible person to administer and man-
age the infrastructure on which CARDIO:DE will be stored.
The data request will be approved, if it contains all requested information and if it is in line with the data 
usage agreement (DUA). The data request will be rejected, if it contains incomplete or incorrect information or 
if it violates regulations of the DUA.
Baseline classifier. 
We use baseline classifiers to demonstrate what current well-established and freely avail-
able machine learning models could achieve out-of-the-box on CARDIO:DE annotations. We trained our classi-
fiers on annotations of CARDIO:DE400 and assessed their performance on annotations of CARDIO:DE100. For 
these models we performed neither hyperparameter tuning, nor architecture optimization. The results published 
here are intended to give a first impression of possible applications and how to train MIE models on CARDIO:DE 
annotations for both tasks. In a future shared task, researchers are invited to improve these baseline results.
Medication information extraction. 
As an example use case, we evaluated a statistical and a neural machine 
learning model for medication information extraction. Our statistical model is based on a well-established condi-
tional random field (CRF)35. The CRF was trained on basic linguistic features, including POS tags and context token. 
We used features proposed by Mikhail Korobov, see https://sklearn-crfsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#features, 
for further details see Figure S1 in Supplementary File 3. Our neural model is based on a well-documented 
Hugging Face BERT language model for NER, pre-trained on different publicly available German language corpora 
(deepset/gbert-base)36,37.
In addition, we evaluated the freely available German GGPONC NER classifier (04_ggponc_fine_long), trained 
on SNOMED CT (https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCSTART/6.+SNOMED+CT+Concept+Model, 
accessed 08.09.2022) annotations in GGPONC 2.011. The fine-grained scheme includes the entity type Clinical Drug. 
For a detailed description of this class, see GGPONC 2.0 guidelines: (https://github.com/hpi-dhc/ggponc_annota-
tion/blob/master/annotation_guide/anno_guide.pdf, accessed 08.09.2022). Clinical Drug describes a pharmaceutical 
product produced for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. While the guidelines do not exactly match our definition of 
Drug/ActiveIng we follow two mappings during evaluation, (1) mapping Clinical Drug to our Drug/ActiveIng (short) 
and (2) to Drug/ActiveIng/Frequency/Strength (long).
The task was designed as entity recognition classification. The objective of this task is to assign a set of six 
medication information classes (ActiveIng, Drug, Duration, Form, Frequency, Strength) to each input token. 
Medication information can consist of one single token or a sequence of tokens. Figure 9 shows a tokenized 
input snippet, containing 20 token and their assigned medication information classes. We evaluated this task 
using the F1-score, the harmonic mean between precision and recall per class, and the micro-average F1-score 
per classifier (Table 10). We evaluated token-wise and without an IOB scheme (short for inside, outside, begin-
ning notation, see, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging)), 
accessed 08.09.2022). Therefore, we removed all “B-” and “I-” substrings from the labels before calculating pre-
cision and recall. Token-wise results for precision, recall and F1-score of the GGPONC NER classifier are listed 
in Table 11.
Considering token-wise and entity-wise micro average F1-score, BERT shows slightly higher results 
than CRF. Regarding token-wise F1-score BERT outperforms CRF over all classes. This is also true for the 
low-frequency class Form. Furthermore, this class achieved the overall lowest F1-score for both models.
Results of GGPONC NER shows the highest F1-score for the long mapping (81%), along with a balanced 
precision and recall score. The short mapping shows an overall much lower F1-score (0.21) along with a much 
lower precision (0.13) than recall score (0.67). For further evaluation results, see Supplementary File 4.
Considering different domains (oncology vs. cardiology) and document types (guidelines vs. doctor’s let-
ters), the cross-domain GGPONC NER baseline showed impressive results on the CARDIO:DE100 corpus 
split. The short mapping achieved a recall of 0.67, while the precision score was only 0.13. This was especially 
due to issues while mapping our medication information classes based on our guidelines to the more generic

GGPONC Snomed CT class Clinical Drug. We frequently observed, that GGPONC NER annotates token 
sequences such as 20 mg (Strength) or 1-0-0 (Frequency) as Clinical Drug, resulting in a high amount of false 
positives. Hence, our long mapping using the more comprehensive mapping of Clinical Drug to four classes 
Drug/ActiveIng/Frequency/Strength achieved both a high precision score (0.81) and a high recall score (0.80). 
These results show the potential of cross-domain models for German MIE. We therefore leave it to future work, 
to systematically evaluate the performance of publicly available German MIE models on already distributable 
German medical corpora. For a detailed analysis of GGPONC NER, see Supplementary File 4.
Current SOTA results for medication information extraction on English datasets achieve up to 0.95 F1-score3. 
Considering different data sets and hyperparameters a comparable German model for medication extraction for 
the classes ActiveIng/Drug (Clinical Drug) recognition in the GGPONC 2.0 corpus achieves 0.91 F-score, thus, 
outperforms our more fine-grained baseline distinguishing between Drug (0.81) and ActiveIng (0.86).
Section classification. 
Equal to the medication information extraction task, we evaluated a statistical 
and a neural model for section classification. For the statistical model we opted for a support vector machine 
(SVM)38. Our neural model is based on a well-documented Hugging Face BERT language model for sequence 
classification, pre-trained on different publicly available German language corpora (deepset/gbert-base)36,37. 
The objective of this task was to assign a set of fourteen section types (Anrede, AktuellDiagnosen, Diagnosen, 
AllergienUnverträglichkeitenRisiken, Anamnese, AufnahmeMedikation, KUBefunde, Befunde, EchoBefunde, Labor, 
Zusammenfassung, Mix, EntlassMedikation, Abschluss) to each input sample. An input sample consists of a par-
agraph of text (a paragraph is defined by the MS Word “¶” character) extracted from a doctor’s letter with no 
further context information. Figure 10 shows a tokenized example of an input sample, containing 48 tokens 
assigned to the Anrede class. We evaluated this task using the F1-score per class and the macro average F1-score 
per classifier (Table 12).
Analyzing the macro average F1-score the BERT model outperforms the baseline by 0.02. Taking the per 
class F1-score into account, BERT achieves a better score in nine section classes. In four section classes both 
models achieve the same score, while for the class EntlassMedikation SVM achieves a higher F1-score.
Both models worst performing classes are related to medication sections. We observe a very low recall score 
for AufnahmeMedikation for the SVM and for EntlassMedikation for the BERT model. The SVM frequently 
classifies AufnahmeMedikation instances as EntlassMedikation. The BERT model, on the other hand, frequently 
misclassifies EntlassMedikation instances as AufnahmeMedikation, but to a lesser extent (confusion matrices

for both models, see Figure S2 and Figure S3 in Supplementary File 3). Due to the fact that this task was per-
formed only as a simple text classification task without further context information, these errors cannot be easily 
avoided, only by merging these class types or by adding context information to each input sample.
Regarding our baseline classifiers, considering different datasets, language and annotation guidelines, our 
final accuracy scores for SVM and BERT are comparable to similar published section classification results31.
Again, our two show cases on medical information extraction and section classification serve to demonstrate 
the great potential of this first German corpus from the cardiovascular domain. For future work, more sophisti-
cated document segmentation methods need to be applied39,40.
