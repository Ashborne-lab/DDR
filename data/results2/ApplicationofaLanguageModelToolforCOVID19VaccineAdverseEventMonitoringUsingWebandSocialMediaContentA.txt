Abstract
Background:
Spontaneous pharmacovigilance
reporting systems are the main
data source for signal detection for
vaccines. However, there is a large
time lag between the occurrence of
an adverse event (AE) and the
availability for analysis. With global
mass COVID-19 vaccination
campaigns, social media, and web
content, there is an opportunity for
real-time, faster monitoring of AEs
potentially related to COVID-19
vaccine use. Our work aims to
detect AEs from social media to
augment those from spontaneous
reporting systems.
Objective:
This study aims to monitor AEs
shared in social media and online
support groups using medical
context-aware natural language
processing language models.
Methods:
We developed a language model–
based web app to analyze social
media, patient blogs, and forums
(from 190 countries in 61
languages) around COVID-19
vaccine–related keywords.
Following machine translation to
English, lay language safety terms
(ie, AEs) were observed using the
PubmedBERT-based named-entity
recognition model (precision=0.76
and recall=0.82) and mapped to
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA) terms using
knowledge graphs (MedDRA
terminology is an internationally
used set of terms relating to
medical conditions, medicines, and
medical devices that are developed
and registered under the auspices
of the International Council for
Harmonization of Technical
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals
for Human Use). Weekly and
cumulative aggregated AE counts,
proportions, and ratios were
displayed via visual analytics, such
as word clouds.
Results:
Most AEs were identified in 2021,
with fewer in 2022. AEs observed
using the web app were consistent
with AEs communicated by health
authorities shortly before or within
the same period.
Conclusions:
Monitoring the web and social
media provides opportunities to
observe AEs that may be related to
the use of COVID-19 vaccines. The
presented analysis demonstrates
the ability to use web content and
social media as a data source that
could contribute to the early
observation of AEs and enhance
postmarketing surveillance. It could
help to adjust signal detection
strategies and communication with
external stakeholders, contributing
to increased confidence in vaccine
safety monitoring.

Introduction
An adverse event (AE) is defined
by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) as any
undesirable experience associated
with the use of a medical product
(including vaccines) in a patient [1].
It can be challenging to assess
uncommon or rare AEs in clinical
trials due to the low number of
patients enrolled in the trials and
strict inclusion criteria. Therefore,
postmarketing surveillance in a
real-world setting is important to
gain knowledge of any AE for
manufacturers and regulatory
bodies, including the FDA and
European Medicines Agency
(EMA), as well as international
organizations such as the World
Health Organization (WHO). New
safety signals are defined by the
EMA as “information on a new or
known AE that may be caused by a
medicine and requires further
investigation” [2]. Organizations
(pharmaceutical companies, drug
regulators, distributors,
wholesalers, and retailers) conduct
postmarket pharmacovigilance
surveillance both passively and
actively, using systems including
postauthorization safety studies, as
well as voluntary and mandatory
surveillance such as the US
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) or FDA Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS), MedWatch,
Eudravigilance, and the WHO’s
Vigibase. The reporting of
suspected or observed AEs is
mandatory for manufacturers and in
many countries for health care
professionals, however, the public
may be unaware of AE reporting
systems or feel a lack of obligation
to report AEs, which in some cases
may lead to delayed and
incomplete records [3-6]. In
addition, there can be a lag time
between the reporting of an AE to
the regulators and the information
being available to the vaccine
manufacturer from public sources.
With the advent of the COVID-19
pandemic, with new vaccines being
developed at speed and vaccines
introduced in mass campaigns,
assessing very rare AEs at the time
of emergency use authorization has
been difficult. Postmarketing AE
reporting systems have become
central to determining AEs and
there have been some endeavors
to decrease the lag time between
reporting of an AE and information
being available to the public.
Social media [7] has seen recent
unprecedented growth in the
numbers of users worldwide and in
large populations of patients
actively involved in sharing and
posting health-related information
[7]. This wealth of information has
consequently led to data from such
discussions being increasingly
used for monitoring AEs [7-10], with
the advantage of these occurring
closer to real time than traditional
postmarketing AE reporting
systems. Many study groups have
made use of natural language
processing (NLP) and artificial
intelligence methods [7,11,12],
including the use of quantum
computing [10,13], to observe AEs
from social media data [7,10-12]
and have had promising outcomes
[10]. The COVID-19 pandemic has
been at the heart of discussions on
social media and the strong patient
voice, discussing every concern
surrounding COVID-19 vaccines in
real time, has been documented in
many studies [14-21]. Of note,
Portelli et al [22] developed a tool
that collected and analyzed public
reaction to specific COVID-19
vaccines on 650,000 English
language X (formerly Twitter;
Twitter, Inc) posts (formerly tweets)
since December 2020, including
sentiment and AEs. Using a
symptom extraction module, they
showed news coverage had a high
impact on topics discussed.
Safety surveillance will continue to
evolve as there is currently a delay
in reporting of AEs. A context-
aware language model (LM), unlike
a dictionary method, increases the
sophistication of methods, for
example, the interpretation of
“corona” as a medical term and a
nonmedical term [23]. Our work
aims to detect AEs from social
media to augment those from
spontaneous reporting systems.
The ability to monitor AEs on social
media in real time has the potential
to enhance postmarketing
surveillance. Therefore, our
objective was to monitor AEs and
the related trends shared in social
media and online support groups
associated with COVID-19
vaccines using medical context-
aware LMs.
The safety signals reported here
have been denoted as AEs as they
are mapped to Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)
preferred terms (PTs). However,
they are not fully aligned with the
definition of AEs that are subject to
reporting to health authorities
according to applicable regulations.
Methods
Overview
Our LM-powered web app is
referred to as the Soteria web app
from here onwards (Figure 1).
Following machine translation to
English, lay language AEs related
to the safety of COVID-19 vaccines
were detected using a named-entity
recognition model and mapped to
the International Council for
Harmonization (ICH) MedDRA
standards. Visual analytics as word
clouds and line graphs were
available on the graphical user
interface to analyze across periods
any trending of AEs (counts,
proportions, and ratios) by
COVID-19 vaccine brand,
mechanism (messenger ribonucleic
acid [mRNA], adenovirus vector,
and protein), country, or special
population (pediatrics or pregnant
women). These can also be
grouped by MedDRA hierarchy
levels—system organ class (SOC),
high-level group term (HLGT), high-
level term (HLT), and PT, according
to the latest version of MedDRA
(23.0-24.0 in this analysis) as per
Maintenance and Support Services
Organization recommendations.
Contextual lexicons were
generated to describe the pediatric
population, pregnant population,
and vaccine brand. Fuzzy matching
detected if these topics were co-
occurring with a medDRA PT
mention.
Soteria Web App
Neural Machine Translation
Non-English content in the data
stream was translated to English
before sending it to the LM for AE
observation or detection. For each
non-English sentence, the Amazon
Translate neural machine
translation service or Helsinki-NLP
[24] translation models were used
according to the source language
(Multimedia Appendix 1) and the
data source (data from X were
translated using Helsinki-NLP,
respecting X application
programming interface [API] user
agreement policies on not sending
X posts to third parties). The
translations from these machine
translation models are continuously
evaluated and validated by open-
source communities [24] and
Amazon Web Services. The
Amazon Translate neural machine
translation service is an off-the-
shelf, usage-based service and
Helsinki-NLP is noncommercial and
open-source. Non-English
sentences written using the
standard English alphabet were
removed due to known poor
performance with machine
translation models. COVID-19
vaccines monitored via the Soteria
web app are listed in Multimedia
Appendix 2.
AE Observation or Detection
Model
We fine-tuned the pretrained LM,
PubmedBERT [25], to perform a
token-level classification task to
obtain a named-entity recognition
model using 2 publicly available
datasets, adverse drug events
(ADE)-Corpus-V2 [26] and
psychiatric treatment adverse
reactions (PsyTAR) [27]. The ADE-
Corpus-V2 data contained 4271
sentences with AEs and 16,625
without, the PsyTAR data
contained 4813 ADE mentions. The
2 datasets were combined and
“machine labeled” for all ADE using
the inside, outside, and beginning
format and split into 70% training,
20% validation, and 10% test sets.
The training was in 3 epochs with a
batch size of 32 with a loss function
of categorical cross-entropy. The
final model’s performance was
evaluated on the test set using
precision (the proportion of
sentences that had an AE among
all sentences the algorithm had
identified an AE), recall (the
proportion of sentences the
algorithm identified an AE among
all sentences with an AE), and F1-
score (harmonic mean of the
precision and recall, which is a
measure of accuracy).

All analyses were performed in
Python (version 3; Python Software
Foundation) and with the module
torch [28]. This named entity
recognition model detected AEs in
the Soteria web app (Figure 1).
The validation set was used to
search for the hyperparameters
that yielded the best performance
for this set. The final model was
trained on the entire dataset
(training set plus evaluation set)
and evaluated on a separate test
set. Fivefold cross-validation was
used for this process. After the final
model had been trained, in the test
phase, a new separate test set (not
used during the training or
validation process) provided an
unbiased estimate of the model’s
performance on unseen data. In
order to account for the variability
introduced by the random split, the
model was trained and evaluated
on each fold separately, with the
results averaged across all folds to
obtain a final estimate of the
model’s performance [29].
MedDRA PT Lexical
Expansion
We first performed a lexical
expansion of MedDRA PTs using
the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) metathesaurus
[30]. Each MedDRA PT was
mapped with UMLS synonyms that
have the same concept unique
identifier but were from a different
vocabulary other than MedDRA
(Multimedia Appendix 3).
Lay language safety terms detected
by the named-entity recognition
model in the Soteria web app were
mapped to MedDRA PT using
these lexical expansions derived
from the UMLS metathesaurus
(Figure 1) using fuzzy matching.
This mapping of AEs into MedDRA
terminology allowed the
harmonization of terms for a better
understanding of patients’ chatting.
AE Trend Generation
Using mapped MedDRA terms,
reports were generated in the
Soteria web app as weekly or
monthly AE count (for period and
cumulative), proportion, ratio, and
95% CI around the ratio.
[image]
[image]
[image]
These metrics can be calculated for
combinations of groupings by
country, mechanism (mRNA,
adenovirus vector, and protein),
COVID-19 vaccine brand names,
and MedDRA levels (PT, HLT,
HLGT, and SOC; Figure 2).
These trends are presented as
word clouds, tables with monthly
top 50 AEs, and time trend line
plots (Figure 3).
Data Source
We obtained mentions of
COVID-19 vaccine–related
keywords from web content and
social media via the API of the
social listening tool from Synthesio
Ltd using license-based data
access via the API. Details of this
tool can be obtained from
Synthesio. Overall, mentions were
collected from 190 countries in 61
different languages using a data
query to identify mentions of a
COVID-19 vaccine using COVID-19
vaccine–related keywords
(Multimedia Appendix 4).
The social media types (as defined
in the Soteria API) included are
forums (excluding press releases),
X, social networks, and comments
and consumer opinions in the
Soteria web app data stream via
the Synthesio API. Adhering to X
platform agreements and policies,
Synthesio does not share the X
posts via the API but only the X
post ID. Using these X post IDs, we
recovered the X post using the X
API, a process at that time called
“Twitter rehydration.” Synthesio Ltd
does not share a list of social
media platforms and websites.
Considering the data volume, an
analysis of the social media
platform and website was not
performed. While Synthesio Ltd API
was used to collect social media
and web content data for the
Soteria web app, this data stream
can be easily replaced by a similar
provider’s API, X API, or a custom-
built program to scrape web data
(the authors do not recommend
custom-built programs due to the
nontrivial nature of the task in terms
of technology, privacy, and
compliance).
Data collection started on
November 12, 2020, with automatic
periodic weekly analysis of posts
from the prior week and
concatenation with all historic
aggregated counts. In this analysis,
results until April 2022 are
presented (except for cumulative
word counts, which are from
October 2022).
Ethical Considerations
The data analyzed does not contain
any personal information but only
the text data that mention a vaccine
based on our query. The
processing is an in-memory
process that is completed within 24
hours and text data are not
retained. Only aggregated counts
of AEs were retained. This type of
analysis does not require an
institutional review board or ethics
committee review. Sanofi follows
the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) and Personal
Information Protection Law (PIPL)
and similar country-related policies
for data protection. Synthesio also
follows GDPR and other country-
related policies for data protection
and adheres to platform
agreements or policies of all
platforms they query from. For data
and API acquired via X, Sanofi
adhered to the X developer
agreement and policy.
Results
AE Detection Model
The AE detection model had
precision=0.76, recall=0.82, and
F1-score=0.79 when evaluated on
the test dataset (the AE
Observation or Detection Model
section provides details on the test
dataset). This meant that 76% of
the results were relevant and out of
all positive predictions that could
have been made, 82% were
correct, resulting in 79% accuracy.
Using the AE detection model,
between November 2020 and
December 2021, around 1 AE was
observed at the MedDRA PT level
for every 500 COVID-19 vaccine
mentions and in 2022, this rate
decreased to about 1 AE for every
2000 mentions. A considerably
large portion of these AEs came
from X data. Not every COVID-19
mention was associated with an
AE.
AE Trends Analyses
Number of AEs by Country
The countries with most AEs
observed were the United States
(>15,000), United Kingdom
(~5000), Italy (~2000), France
(~2000), Australia (~2000), Japan
(~1000), Singapore (~800),
Philippines (~650), and Canada
(~600; Figure 4). The number of
AEs observed varied each week
and were less frequent in 2022
compared with 2021 (the
distribution as of April 2022 is
shown in Figure 5).
Number of AEs by Type of
COVID-19 Vaccine (Platform
and Brand)
The AEs observed were mostly
related to mRNA vaccines and
adenovirus vector vaccines while
some AEs were related to
inactivated virus vaccines and
protein vaccines (Figure 6). AEs
related to mRNA vaccines were
first observed in December 2020
with a peak of 1400 in January
2021. AEs related to adenovirus
vector vaccines increased from
March 2020 with peaks of
approximately 1200 in April and
May 2021. AEs observed for mRNA
vaccines stayed relatively high and
stable during 2021, while in
adenovirus vector vaccines’
decreased in the second quarter
and over the year (Figure 6).
Most AEs between November 2020
and April 2022 were associated
with vaccines approved by the
health authorities, that is, the
mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-
BioNTech and Moderna, and the
adenovirus vector vaccines from
AstraZeneca and Janssen
(Johnson & Johnson). There were
also many AEs where the
administered vaccine names or
pharmaceutical companies were
not mentioned (Figure 7).
Types of AEs
COVID-19 Vaccine Platform
The most frequently observed AEs
for mRNA vaccines were
headache, fatigue, pyrexia or
hyperthermia, chills, nausea, pain
or tenderness, and myalgia or
muscle discomfort. The next most
frequently observed AEs were
those identified in the
postmarketing setting—myocarditis
and anaphylactic reactions
(Multimedia Appendix 5).
The most commonly observed AE
for adenovirus vector vaccines was
thrombosis, which was also the AE
identified in the postmarketing
setting. The number of headaches
and pyrexia, hyperthermia, or body
temperature AEs all increased over
time. Thrombocytopenia or platelet
count AEs were associated with a
specific syndrome “thrombosis with
thrombocytopenia” and decreased
over time (Multimedia Appendix 5).
COVID-19 Vaccine Brand
The AE “thrombosis” associated
with the AstraZeneca vaccine
(adenovirus vector) started to
emerge in March 2021, and the
word “COVID-19” related to the
Sinopharm vaccine (inactivated
virus) started to emerge in June
2021 (Multimedia Appendix 6).
The AEs observed associated with
the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna
vaccines (both mRNA) were similar,
but a higher number of patients
mentioned anaphylactic reactions
regarding the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine than the Moderna vaccine
(Multimedia Appendix 7).
The AEs observed associated with
AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines
(both adenovirus vectors) were
different, with thrombosis being the
most reported AE for the
AstraZeneca vaccine and
hyperthermia or pyrexia, fatigue,
and headache followed by
thrombosis and chills for the
Janssen vaccine (Multimedia
Appendix 7).
Anaphylactic reaction AEs started
to trend in mid-December 2020
(under HLT “Anaphylactic and
anaphylactoid responses”) shortly
after the introduction of the mRNA
vaccines (Figure 8).
Thrombo-embolic AEs started to
trend on March 13, 2021, for
adenovirus vector COVID-19
vaccines with HLTs including
pulmonary thrombotic and embolic
conditions, nonsite-specific
embolism and thrombosis.
Myocarditis or pericarditis AEs
started to trend for mRNA
COVID-19 vaccines on May 1,
2021, with an increased ratio
(proportion of noninfectious
myocarditis HLT of the current
period as compared to the previous
one) on May 29, 2021. The
proportion of myocarditis (count of
myocarditis HLT divided by the
count of all HLTs within the period)
was the highest from September
2021 onwards (Multimedia
Appendix 5).
Subgroup Analyses
Pediatric Population
The most frequently observed AEs
as of April 2022 for the pediatric
population were carditis,
myocarditis, hyperthermia, fatigue,
and headache, followed by chills,
anaphylaxis, and tenderness
(Multimedia Appendix 8).
Pregnant Women
The most frequently observed AEs
as of April 2022 for the pregnant
women population were
hyperthermia, fatigue, pyrexia, and
headache, followed by chills,
nausea, tenderness, and
spontaneous abortion (Multimedia
Appendix 8).
Discussion
Principal Findings
Monitoring the web and social
media provides opportunities to
observe both AEs and patient
concerns around the safety of
COVID-19 vaccines. We developed
an LM powered web app (Soteria)
to analyze web content related to
COVID-19 vaccine AEs.
Using the Soteria web app, we
were able to observe AEs
associated with COVID-19
vaccines by country, vaccine brand,
and by MedDRA level (PT, HLT,
HLGT, and SOC) using data from
social media and web content.
Because social media and web
content data are readily available
and can be accessed and analyzed
quickly, the Soteria web app could
observe AEs in real time, much
faster than detection using
traditional spontaneous reporting
systems, which have a larger time
gap between the occurrence of an
AE and the availability of data for
analysis.
Results from our analyses were, in
general, consistent with those from
other sources. For example, our
study showed that the number of
AEs observed for COVID-19 mRNA
vaccines remained relatively high
and stable during 2021, aligning
with the first COVID-19 vaccination
campaigns, while for COVID-19
adenovirus vector vaccines the
number of AEs decreased over the
year, again consistent with the
decreasing use of these types of
vaccines. Widely known AEs for
specific COVID-19 vaccines were
also consistent with our findings
using the Soteria web app, such as
the thrombosis related to the
AstraZeneca vaccine that started to
emerge from March 2021 [31].
Other AEs observed using the
Soteria app (anaphylactic reaction,
myocarditis, and thrombosis) were
also consistent with those
communicated by different Health
Authorities shortly before or
concurrently [32-34]. Over time,
there were fewer mentions of AEs
observed in social media, reflecting
the reduction of COVID-19 mass
vaccination campaigns.
When a new drug or a vaccine is
released onto the market, the only
safety concerns reported will be
those arising during a clinical trial,
which typically has limits due to the
small patient numbers, is
conducted over a limited time
period and has a long list of patient
exclusion criteria. It is, therefore,
essential to capture AEs that occur
after the trial in a real-world setting.
Pharmacovigilance systems have
been set up to capture this
information, including the
Eudravigilance reporting system in
Europe and the CDC or FDA
VAERS in the United States. It is
mandatory for manufacturers to
report any AEs, but voluntary for
some health care professionals and
the public. Some patients may not
know how to report AEs or know
about the systems in place for
reporting AEs; therefore, social
media is an important data source
that can be used to harness social
reaction and, with the use of LM to
observe AEs, as in this analysis. In
addition, social media data can
provide information on AEs in real
time without any filter or having to
wait for reporting through standard
AE systems, which can take at
least 2 months. This is particularly
important in situations such as the
COVID-19 pandemic when new
vaccines released onto the market
may not have completed lengthy
trials, which is when many AEs are
discovered. In this analysis, the
data were collected soon after
publication, that is, collated every
week automatically and the use of
the MedDRA terms allowed the
identification of AEs using the same
terms as traditional VAERS and
Eudravigilance reporting systems.
There can be bias in
pharmacovigilance systems, as not
all patients are aware of
spontaneous pharmacovigilance
reporting. However, social media is
widely accessible, and patients
discuss AEs, especially during a
pandemic. This provides the
opportunity to detect AEs from
social media to augment the bias in
spontaneous reporting. However,
social media is not structured to
capture AEs the way spontaneous
reporting systems are and even
with context-aware LMs, false
positives and false negatives can
occur. Previous analyses of social
media have been undertaken for
AEs relating to Zika, Ebola, and
dengue viruses. There is a
suggestion, however, that illnesses
less prevalent in the news may be
better for prediction as there is less
influence and bias through media
outlets [35]. Although, some rare
illnesses with a smaller population
would need sufficient social media
comments for meaningful analysis.
Studies using social media listening
have tended to focus on vaccine
hesitancy and sentiment [14-22].
The work presented here using the
Soteria web app has some
similarities to previous studies,
especially the work from Portelli et
al [22], which, as our analysis, used
continuous data collection and
processing, global data collection,
and used a transformer-pretrained
LM for AE detection. However, our
Soteria web app differs in that it
includes a multitude of social media
listening, including patient blogs
and forums beyond X, it also uses
AE coding using ICH standards
(MedDRA) rather than focusing on
sentiment. AAs well, it does not
focus only on English but uses
translation models to be able to
include mentions from 190
countries in 61 different languages.
Finally, the generation of trends
using multiple dimensions (vaccine
brand, mechanism, country,
different hierarchy levels MedDRA,
and special populations: pediatrics
or pregnant women) and
combinations of these dimensions
(eg, AEs into a pediatric group who
received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine)
can be undertaken via the graphical
user interface using visual
analytics. For example, the top
serious AEs reported via VAERS
for children aged 5-11 years who
received the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 vaccine, according to a
published study [32], were incorrect
dose, vomiting, fever, and
headache, and in a parallel study
for children aged 12-17 years were
dizziness, syncope, nausea,
headache, and fever [33]. These
AEs align with the AEs observed
using the Soteria web app. In
addition, preliminary findings of
mRNA COVID-19 vaccine safety in
pregnant women have shown that
the most frequently reported
pregnancy-related AE was
spontaneous abortion, again
aligning with the AE observed in
this analysis [34].
It is important to note that these
AEs are not necessarily safety
signals, as safety signals have a
very specific definition: “information
on a new or known AE that may be
caused by a medicine and requires
further investigation” (EMA) [36]. In
fact, 1 study showed that the
current methods of signal detection
using social media did not perform
well and could not be used to
replace or integrate with the current
pharmacovigilance activities [5].
However, these AEs observed from
social media can potentially be of
importance to adjust signal
detection, assessment strategies,
and communication with external
stakeholders. For example, AEs
observed from social media could
augment and optimize existing
signal detection processes in place,
or even become the focus of signal
assessment that traditionally uses
data sources such as electronic
health records. AEs observed via
the Soteria app have the potential
to inform the companies earlier
than those of traditional
postmarketing AE reporting
systems, therefore, allowing early
and timely alerts of rare AEs.
Limitations
This study has limitations. The
chatting habits are different
between countries, for example,
there was a higher availability of
chats from the United States
possibly leading to country bias. In
addition, the frequency of chats
may be affected by the media
coverage within that country. As
well, although social media and X
reposts and reshares are only
counted once, the same person
may post the same AE several
times, leading to over-reporting
(although this can also occur within
the VAERS system). Also, there
may be false negatives due to
incorrect translations (non-English
sentences written using the
standard English alphabet were
removed as we were aware of poor
performance with machine
translation models at the time).
Finally, these posts are not true
diagnoses, and the people
providing the chat may not
experience the events or be aware
of their medical diagnosis.
While BERT was the only available
LM at the time of this work, this
entire pipeline can be redone with
novel LMs available today.
Similarly, benchmark datasets for
AE detection in social media are
now available that can be used to
measure the performance of the
model. Further external validation
of the model using these
benchmark datasets could enhance
the reliability of the model’s
performance claims.
Future studies could include an
artificial intelligence–based signal
detection (instead of AE detection)
with validation using more
traditional methods and more
commonly used data sources, such
as VAERS, claims, and electronic
medical records databases. Similar
tools could be developed to monitor
the safe use of vaccines other than
COVID-19 vaccines or drugs.
Of note, as of November 23, 2022,
X has not enforced their COVID-19
misinformation policy. A
comparison of data before and after
this date could be of interest, for
example, to determine if the
removal of this policy influenced
vaccine AEs discussed within X.
Conclusions
The application of LM to monitor
web and social media data
provides opportunities to observe
AEs associated with COVID-19
vaccines faster compared to the
traditional spontaneous reporting
systems, which have a longer lag
time between the occurrence of
AEs and the availability of data.
This gives the potential to enhance
postmarketing surveillance. While
AEs are not necessarily signals that
require further analyses to confirm,
they could help to adjust signal
detection strategies by refocusing
signal assessment on observed
AEs and help to improve
communication with external
stakeholders, contributing to
increased confidence in vaccines’
monitoring and safety. While
“chatting” regarding AEs following
COVID-19 vaccination is
decreasing in social media, our LM-
based AE detection model can be
applied to other vaccines and
medicines.
