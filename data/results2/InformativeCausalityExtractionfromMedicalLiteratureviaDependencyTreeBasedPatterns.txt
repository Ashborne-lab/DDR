Abstract
Extracting cause-effect entities from medical literature is an important
task in medical information retrieval. A solution for solving this task can
be used for compilation of various causality relations, such as causality
between disease and symptoms, between medications and side effects,
and between genes and diseases. Existing solutions for extracting
cause-effect entities work well for sentences where the cause and the
effect phrases are name entities, single-word nouns, or noun phrases
consisting of two to three words. Unfortunately, in medical literature,
cause and effect phrases in a sentence are not simply nouns or noun
phrases, rather they are complex phrases consisting of several words,
and existing methods fail to correctly extract the cause and effect entities
in such sentences. Partial extraction of cause and effect entities conveys
poor quality, non-informative, and often, contradictory facts, comparing to
the one intended in the given sentence. In this work, we solve this
problem by designing an unsupervised method for cause and effect
phrase extraction, PatternCausality, which is specifically suitable for the
medical literature. Our proposed approach first uses a collection of
cause-effect dependency patterns as template to extract head words of
cause and effect phrases and then it uses a novel phrase extraction
method to obtain complete and meaningful cause and effect phrases
from a sentence. Experiments on a cause-effect dataset built from
sentences from PubMed articles show that for extracting cause and
effect entities, PatternCausality is substantially better than the existing
methods—with an order of magnitude improvement in the F-score metric
over the best of the existing methods. We also build different variants of
PatternCausality, which use different phrase extraction methods; all
variants are better than the existing methods. PatternCausality and its
variants also show modest performance improvement over the existing
methods for extracting cause and effect entities in a domain-neutral
benchmark dataset, in which cause and effect entities are nouns or noun
phrases consisting of one to two words.
