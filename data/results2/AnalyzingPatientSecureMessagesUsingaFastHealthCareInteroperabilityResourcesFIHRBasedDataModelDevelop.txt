Abstract
Background: Patient portals tethered to electronic health records systems have become attractive web platforms since the
enacting of the Medicare Access and Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act and the introduction of the
Meaningful Use program in the United States. Patients can conveniently access their health records and seek consultation from
providers through secure web portals. With increasing adoption and patient engagement, the volume of patient secure messages
has risen substantially, which opens up new research and development opportunities for patient-centered care.
Objective: This study aims to develop a data model for patient secure messages based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resources (FHIR) standard to identify and extract significant information.
Methods: We initiated the first draft of the data model by analyzing FHIR and manually reviewing 100 sentences randomly
sampled from more than 2 million patient-generated secure messages obtained from the online patient portal at the Mayo Clinic
Rochester between February 18, 2010, and December 31, 2017. We then annotated additional sets of 100 randomly selected
sentences using the Multi-purpose Annotation Environment tool and updated the data model and annotation guideline iteratively
until the interannotator agreement was satisfactory. We then created a larger corpus by annotating 1200 randomly selected
sentences and calculated the frequency of the identified medical concepts in these sentences. Finally, we performed topic modeling
analysis to learn the hidden topics of patient secure messages related to 3 highly mentioned microconcepts, namely, fatigue,
prednisone, and patient visit, and to evaluate the proposed data model independently.
Results: The proposed data model has a 3-level hierarchical structure of health system concepts, including 3 macroconcepts,
28 mesoconcepts, and 85 microconcepts. Foundation and base macroconcepts comprise 33.99% (841/2474), clinical macroconcepts
comprise 64.38% (1593/2474), and financial macroconcepts comprise 1.61% (40/2474) of the annotated corpus. The top 3
mesoconcepts among the 28 mesoconcepts are condition (505/2474, 20.41%), medication (424/2474, 17.13%), and practitioner
(243/2474, 9.82%). Topic modeling identified hidden topics of patient secure messages related to fatigue, prednisone, and patient
visit. A total of 89.2% (107/120) of the top-ranked topic keywords are actually the health concepts of the data model.
Conclusions: Our data model and annotated corpus enable us to identify and understand important medical concepts in patient
secure messages and prepare us for further natural language processing analysis of such free texts. The data model could be
potentially used to automatically identify other types of patient narratives, such as those in various social media and patient
forums. In the future, we plan to develop a machine learning and natural language processing solution to enable automatic triaging
solutions to reduce the workload of clinicians and perform more granular content analysis to understand patients’ needs and
improve patient-centered care.

Introduction
Background
In the United States, the Medicare Access and CHIP (Children’s
Health Insurance Program) Reauthorization Act [1] and
Meaningful Use program [2] have incentivized the growing
adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and patient health
records with the goal of improving the quality of health care
delivery systems. Consequently, many health care delivery
systems now offer patient portals, tethered to their EHR systems,
that allow patients to access their medical records and
communicate with their clinicians through secure messages [3].
Patient portals encourage patients to become equal partners in
their care and health management and be more engaged and
participatory in shared decision making [4]. After the Health
Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act
was enacted in 2009, patient portals have gained widespread
adoption by health care delivery systems in the United States
[5,6]. In 2017, more than 90% of the health care delivery
systems, including the Veterans Health Administration, Mass
General Brigham, Kaiser Permanente, and the Mayo Clinic,
offered patient portal access to their patients [7]. Currently,
patients send secure web-based messages to request medical
appointments and prescription refills [8,9]. Clinicians send
patients appointment reminders and promote timely preventive
care [10,11]. Patients and clinicians can communicate back and
forth easily and in a timely manner about complex situations
such as new symptoms, follow-up visits, medication concerns,
and medical questions.
With the increase in the number of patients signing up for these
portals, the number of secure messages has risen substantially
[12-15]. Unfortunately, the content of the large number of
patient secure messages in free-text format has not been
processed and analyzed systematically and incorporated into
the present EHR systems organically to unfold its potential for
improving patient-centered care because of technical hurdles.
For instance, existing annotated corpora have been mainly
developed for sublanguages such as scientific literature in
biomedicine and clinical notes; no annotated corpus is available
for developing natural language processing (NLP) capabilities
in patient-generated formal language. In this study, we propose
to develop a data model of health concepts for patient secure
messages based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resources (FHIR) standard [16].
A data model is usually made up of entities that represent
important items in the domain and relationship assertions among
the entities. In our case, a data model will illustrate the key
concepts occurring in patient secure messages and the
relationships among them. The data model is critical to the
development of any information system (eg, a health information
exchange system or NLP-based semantic representation system
for a patient portal) by providing the definition of the concepts
and format of data. Building the factual and useful data model
requires a deep understanding of the underlying process and
data. Therefore, we also create a large annotated corpus for
analyzing the contents of sampled patient secure messages to
better understand patients’concerns. Once complete, we further
apply topic modeling techniques independently to investigate
whether the patients’focuses and concerns in 3 common medical
conditions align with the developed data model. We build the
annotated corpus primarily to build the data model, and topic
modeling can serve as an independent and primitive validation
of the data model. We choose topic modeling instead of
information extraction because we build the annotated corpus
primarily to build the data model. Topic modeling, as an
unsupervised method, generates results independently of the
corpus and thus can serve as an independent validation of the
data model. We expect a much more rigorous evaluation and
validation by building collaborations and partnerships with
domestic and international researchers in the field.
With all the necessary preparation, our ultimate objective is to
develop an NLP system that will automatically identify and
extract significant information from unstructured patient secure
messages for the purpose of automatically triaging patient secure
messages, reducing the workload of clinicians by chatbot, and
performing more granular and sophisticated content analysis to
understand patients’needs and improve shared decision making
and patient-centered care.
Related Work
As patient secure messages are relatively new, very little
research has focused on automatically identifying and
standardizing their content despite their important implications.
North et al [17] analyzed the content of 6430 secure messages
to assess the overall risk associated with the messages and to
determine whether patients were using portal messages for
symptoms requiring urgent evaluation. Their study showed that
patients used portal messages 3.5% of the time for potentially
high-risk symptoms of chest pain, breathing concerns, abdominal
pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, and vomiting. Sulieman et
al [18] also developed machine learning models on patient portal
secure messages regarding surgical issues to identify message
threads that involve medical decision making from a health care
provider and to classify the complexity of the decision. Cronin
et al [19] built patient portal message classifiers using rule-based
and NLP techniques such as the bag-of-words model. They
curated a gold standard data set of 3253 portal messages
annotated by communication types such as informational,
medical, logistical, and social. This study also focuses on
developing a data model—a standard framework—to address
the issues of content analysis, information extraction, and
integration of significant information from patient secure
messages leveraging Health Level-7 (HL7) FHIR.
HL7 is a nonprofit standard development organization accredited
by the American National Standards Institute, and it is dedicated
to providing a comprehensive framework and related standards

for the data exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of
electronic health information [20]. FHIR is an improved health
data exchange standard that comprehensively defines how
information can be exchanged among different systems
regardless of how it has been stored and allows health care
information to be accessible to those who need it for the benefit
of health care quickly and easily [21]. Instead of traditional
document-centric approaches, HL7 FHIR takes a modular
approach and represents atomic or granular health care data (eg,
heart rate, procedure, medication, and allergies) as independent
modular entities, concepts, and actions involved in health care
information analysis, exchange, and integration as resources
[22]. Existing studies on developing data standards have mostly
focused on analyzing, extracting, and integrating structured data
from EHRs, mobile-based patient health records, and medical
apps. In 2018, Hong et al [23] for the first time introduced a
scalable and standard-based framework for analyzing and
integrating both structured and unstructured EHR data by
leveraging the FHIR specification [23]. The scope and use of
the FHIR framework do not completely meet the requirements
of our study. We aim to develop an HL7 FHIR–based data
model that precisely analyzes and extracts patient secure
messages.
Methods
Overview
A 3-phase workflow for developing the data model and
annotated corpus is shown in Figure 1. We collected more than
2 million patient-generated secure messages from Mayo Clinic
Patient Online Services [24]. We developed the first draft of
the data model and annotation guideline by analyzing FHIR
and manually reviewing 100 sentences from the sampled secure
messages. We then randomly selected, annotated, and examined
additional sets of 100 sentences from the secure messages to
iteratively update the data model and annotation guideline until
interannotator agreement (IAA) was achieved. Subsequently,
we created the annotated corpus by annotating 1200 sentences
from the randomly selected 2100 sentences. Finally, we
calculated the frequency of the identified health concepts in the
annotated corpus and performed topic modeling to extract
hidden topics of all the patient secure messages linked to
frequently mentioned health concepts. In the following sections,
we will discuss data collection and preprocessing, design of the
data model, development of the annotation guideline, creation
and analysis of the annotated corpus, and topic modeling in
more detail. The entire data model can be found in Multimedia
Appendix 1. The details of data set collection and processing
and annotation and topic modeling and annotation guideline
can be found in Multimedia Appendix 2 [16,24-33] and
Multimedia Appendix 3 [1-3,16,24].

Ethics Approval
No patient was exposed to any intervention. We used data from
the Mayo Clinic Unified Data Platform to develop the annotated
corpus and for the analysis. The study was approved by the
Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (19-002211).
Data Set Collection and Preprocessing
The Mayo Clinic Rochester started the patient portal (Patient
Online Services) in 2010 for primary care practice and later
extended it to specialty practice in 2013 [24]. We collected more
than 2 million patient-generated secure messages from the online
patient portal between February 18, 2010, and December 31,
2017. We removed messages with empty message bodies. Each
message has a unique message ID, previous message ID, initial
message ID, sender ID, recipient ID, date and time of the
message creation, message subject, and message body. As we
have mentioned earlier, the details are in Multimedia Appendix
2.
Design of a Data Model for Patient Secure Messages
Creating a data model for unstructured patient narratives is a
very challenging task. After the literature review and initial
analysis of the sampled secure messages, we decided to use the
FHIR standard to develop the data model (Multimedia Appendix
1) because it comprehensively represents the modular entities,
concepts, and actions involved in health care information
exchange.
FHIR defines a hierarchical set of core and infrastructure
resources for handling health concepts in an EHR [34]. After
analyzing version 4 of the FHIR standard [16] and the sampled
secure messages, we generated the first draft of the data model
with 3 hierarchical levels—macroconcepts, mesoconcepts, and
microconcepts—to extract information from the patient secure
messages. We merged and revised some concepts from FHIR
after analyzing the messages. For example, we merged 2 similar
but separately defined top-level concepts (foundation concept
and base concept) in FHIR into 1 macroconcept (foundation
and base concept) in the data model. We also introduced a
microconcept—unspecified—as 
an 
attribute 
under 
all
mesoconcepts. Unspecified refers to the general terms under
most of the mesoconcepts that cannot be categorized into any
specific microconcepts. We deleted some mesoconcepts under
clinical macroconcepts such as clinical impression, detected
issue, medication knowledge, molecular sequence, and care
team because they are not relevant to patient secure messages.
The data model also underwent rounds of revisions during the
annotation process to handle inconsistencies, and disagreement

occurred between the annotators. For instance, in the first draft
of the data model, the mesoconcept patient has 7 microconcepts
following FHIR, such as identifier, name, telecom, gender,
birthdate, address, and marital status. In the final data model,
the mesoconcept patient has 4 microconcepts, such as
unspecified, privacy, lifestyle, and diet, to better understand
patients’ medical records and history. All personal information
related to the patient is kept under privacy to maintain data
privacy.
Development of an Annotation Guideline
For any annotation task, it is important that all annotators follow
the same standard (annotation guideline) to minimize annotation
confusion and errors. We manually reviewed several sets of 100
randomly selected message sentences to develop an annotation
guideline. More specifically, we created the first version of our
annotation guideline by analyzing the first set of 100 message
sentences. Subsequently, our annotators independently annotated
another set of 100 message sentences to examine the
effectiveness of the annotation guideline until the annotators
reached a considerable amount of agreement.
The final annotation guideline consists of 2 sections: (1) the
first section discusses the general annotation rules; (2) the
second section describes the health concepts and associative
rules for the identification and extraction of these concepts
together with specific examples. For instance, it is challenging
to differentiate 2 microconcepts (name and symptoms) under
the mesoconcept condition. The condition-name microconcept
refers to the name of a disease and/or medical condition (eg,
rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and influenza). The
condition-symptom microconcept denotes a physical or mental
feature or symptom (eg, sore bottom and numb arm) of a disease
and/or medical condition. As per general annotation rules, all
modifiers (eg, adjectives and adverbs) and possessives are
removed for annotation to make text spans consistent. For the
cases special calcium pill, this medicine, and my rheumatoid
arthritis, the modifiers and possessives special, this, and my are
not considered for annotation. All patient private information
(eg, name, identity number, and clinic number) is not disclosed
to maintain data privacy. The guideline clearly defines the
concepts and rules to lessen the scope of ambiguity and error
in the annotation and increase the possibility of agreement
among the annotators to develop a quality corpus. The complete
guideline for annotating patient secure messages is listed in
Multimedia Appendix 3.
Development and Analysis of an Annotated Corpus of
Patient Secure Messages
We chose the Multi-purpose Annotation Environment tool to
annotate patient secure messages because of its ease of use and
ability to fix discrepancies [25]. The Multi-purpose Annotation
Environment tool requires a document type definition file with
concept tags and attributes. We chose 2 professional
annotators—a clinically trained linguist and a student
pharmacist—to create a standard error-free corpus. They initially
analyzed and revised several sets of 100 randomly sampled
message sentences to iteratively improve the data model and
annotation guideline. To check the consistency between the
annotators, we calculated the F1 score of 2 separate annotation
sets as the IAA score using General Architecture for Text
Engineering software [26]. The IAA scores were computed
using the F1 score as a criterion at the level of entities. This
helped us to understand the span of the concepts on which the
annotators agreed, disagreed, and partially agreed. We decided
to follow the lenient parameter for measuring the IAA. With
the lenient approach, the annotations that overlap are counted
as a partial match, in contrast with the strict approach in which
the annotations have to match with one another completely. We
can consider this sentence as an example: “My mother has
severe sinus headaches for several months.” Now, if one
annotator annotates “sinus headache” and another annotates
“severe sinus headache,” then the strict IAA approach will give
us no match, but the lenient approach will consider this as an
overlap. The F1 scores of the first set of annotations were 0.42
(macro mean) and 0.67 (micro mean). After discussing and
resolving the disagreements, the annotators annotated another
set of the same sentences, and the F1 scores were quite
satisfactory: 0.62 (macro mean) and 0.74 (micro mean). Our
annotators finally developed a quality corpus of 1200 randomly
selected sentences.
After annotation, we performed summary statistics to calculate
the frequencies of the identified health concepts (ie,
macroconcepts, mesoconcepts, and microconcepts) in the
annotated corpus of patient secure messages. The distribution
of these health concepts helps us to understand which concepts
patients were mostly concerned about and communicated to
their health care providers. The details are provided in
Multimedia Appendix 2.
Topic Modeling
After analyzing the annotated corpus, we selected 3 health
microconcepts (ie, fatigue, prednisone, and patient visit) as
representative cases for topic modeling analysis. The chosen
microconcepts and the corresponding meso concepts and
macroconcepts were frequently discussed in the patient portal
messages (refer to the Results section for more details). Fatigue
is an instance of a top-mentioned microconcept, symptom, under
the condition mesoconcept and clinical macroconcept.
Prednisone is a case of a microconcept, name, under the
medication mesoconcept and clinical macroconcept, about which
patients have expressed most concern in the patient secure
messages. Patient visit is an example of a largely discussed
microconcept, type, under the appointment mesoconcept and
the foundation and base macroconcept.
After multi-word concept encoding and health concept
recognition using MetaMap [27], we collected 41,490, 27,743,
and 95,533 patient secure messages that mentioned the health
microconcepts 
fatigue, 
prednisone, 
and 
patient 
visit,
respectively, to examine the focus of those messages. MetaMap
is a highly configurable program. It has been developed by Dr
Alan Aronson at the National Library of Medicine to map
biomedical texts to the Unified Medical Language System.
Topic modeling automatically identifies topics or themes in a
large collection of documents in terms of a set of keywords that
occur together and most frequently [35,36]. We used latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [28], a state-of-the-art unsupervised
topic modeling method as implemented in Machine Learning

for Language Toolkit [29], to learn the hidden topics of patient
secure messages related to each of the 3 health microconcepts.
After tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization, each
patient secure message was converted into a vocabulary vector
where the elements were the frequency of each lemma (including
Concept Unique Identifier encoded by MetaMap) without
considering the order of the lemma.
We quantitatively calculated topic coherence [30] and asked
domain experts to qualitatively evaluate the learned topics. More
specifically, we evaluated the topic coherence at different topic
numbers (ie, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28,
and 30) to determine the optimal topic number for the 3 selected
health microconcepts. We found that the optimal topic number
was 8 for fatigue-related messages, 10 for prednisone-related
messages, and 12 for patient visit–related messages. We also
investigated the hyperparameters of and in the LDA. controls

Results
Data Model for Patient Secure Messages
The data model for patient secure messages has a 3-level
hierarchical structure consisting of 3 macroconcepts, 28
mesoconcepts, and 85 microconcepts. Textbox 1 provides a
partial illustration of the data model (refer to Multimedia
Appendix 1 for the full data model). The 3 macroconcepts in
the data model are the foundation and base macroconcept,
clinical macroconcept, and financial macroconcept. Foundation
and base concepts are the basic infrastructure of the health care
system concepts on which the rest of the specifications are built.
The mesoconcepts of the foundation and base macroconcept
include patient, practitioner, related person, organization, health
care service, device, appointment, encounter, and document
reference. Clinical macroconcepts refer to core clinical
components, including allergy intolerance, adverse event, body
structure, specimen, condition, procedure, family member
history, observation, laboratory test, imaging, medication,
immunization, care plan, care team, referral, and risk. The
financial macroconcepts cover all finance-related issues such
as coverage eligibility, claim payment, account, and explanation
of benefits. All the mesoconcepts have been further categorized
into microconcepts as attributes, and each mesoconcept has an
unspecified microconcept. For example, as shown in Textbox
1, the mesoconcept patient is categorized as unspecified, privacy,
lifestyle, and diet. The mesoconcept coverage-eligibility has 5
microconcepts, including unspecified, percentage, insurance
ID, benefit category, insurer, and insurance.

Annotated Corpus of Patient Secure Messages
We annotated 1200 sentences of patient secure messages based
on the data model. Figure 2 illustrates the frequency of
hierarchical health concepts in the annotated corpus. The
concepts in blue, purple, and black represent macroconcepts,
mesoconcepts, and microconcepts, respectively. The concepts
in orange illustrate the most frequent microconcepts along with
their occurrences in the annotated text. Foundation and base
macroconcepts make up 33.99% (841/2474) of the annotated
corpus, clinical macroconcepts make up 64.38% (1593/2474)
of the annotated corpus, and financial macroconcepts make up
1.61% (40/2474) of the annotated corpus, respectively. Patients
shared some information about insurance, coverage, and
payments in the secure messages. Among the 28 mesoconcepts,
the most discussed were condition (505/2474, 20.41%),
medication (424/2474, 17.13%), practitioner (243/2474, 9.82%),
patient (189/2474, 7.63%), laboratory test (175/2474, 7.07%),
appointment (164/2474, 6.62%), procedure (150/2474, 6.06%),
and organization (108/2474, 4.36%). The most frequently used

microconcepts were various condition names (eg, fatigue),
medication names (eg, prednisone), and appointment types (eg,
patient visit).

Topics of Patient Secure Messages
After identifying the frequently discussed health concepts, we
used a topic modeling technique to discover the latent topics in
terms of a group of keywords for patient secure messages
mentioning fatigue, prednisone, and patient visit. As shown in
Figure 3, we highlight 8, 10, and 12 meaningful topics of patient
secure messages related to fatigue, prednisone, and patient visit,
respectively. We use a color scheme to represent the top health
microconcepts in the topics of patient secure messages
associated with fatigue, prednisone, and patient visit. More topic
keywords and details can be found in Multimedia Appendix 4.
Among the 120 top keywords, 107 (89.2%) were found to be
health concepts in the data model. The concepts that were not
mapped include general English words such as hours, trouble,
and difficult.

The color indicates different health concepts linked to the topic keywords.
Fatigue
Fatigue is a common clinical condition discussed by patients
in the patient secure messages. Topic modeling on patient secure
messages targeting fatigue showed that most of the patient
discussions were centered around sleepiness, adverse drug
effects, and relevant symptoms and conditions. More
specifically, the keywords sleep, beds, fall, asleep, little, and
wake ups frequently appeared in these patient secure messages,
which highlighted the strong association between fatigue and
sleepiness. The topic words pharmaceutical preparations, dose,
adverse effects, and headache revealed that fatigue might be an
adverse effect related to some drugs. Other relevant symptoms
and conditions such as headache, coughing, fever, and pain
were also found in patient secure messages discussing fatigue.
After tracing back to the original patient secure messages, we

also found mentions of low, thyroid gland, and dietary iron.
This finding is consistent with studies reporting that fatigue is
one of the most common signs of an underactive thyroid
(hypothyroidism) [37] and iron deficiency [38].
Prednisone
Prednisone is a corticosteroid drug that controls inflammation
by suppressing the human immune system. Prednisone appeared
frequently in the patient secure messages. The focus of patient
secure messages related to prednisone was primarily on drug
use, side effects, and disease treatment. The topic words related
to prednisone use and dose such as taper, dose, daily, dosage,
and tapering were mentioned most often. Prednisone has been
used to treat a variety of medical conditions, as shown by the
keywords such as cough, dyspnea, asthma, pruritus, and
urticaria [39-42]. In addition, the patients reported side effects
such as fatigue, headache, sleep and pain after taking prednisone
[43].
Patient Visit
Patient visit is a type (attribute) of patient appointment under
the foundation and base concept. The topics of patient secure
messages related to patient visits revealed various potential
reasons for patient visits by making appointments. For example,
many patients requested appointments to visit the Mayo Clinic
by mentioning their health information and medical records
(mayo, information, and records), laboratory tests and test results
(experimental result, laboratory procedure, blood, scan, and
radionuclide imaging), and medications (pharmaceutical
preparation, prescription procedure, and pharmaceutical
services). The keywords pain, symptoms, headache, coughing,
diarrhea, exanthema, heart, and cardiologists suggest the
purpose of their visit to the Mayo Clinic. In addition, some
patients made appointments for financial issues indicated by
the topic words insurance and pay.
Discussion
Principal Findings
Patient secure messages contain valuable information about the
quality of health care delivery systems, drug efficacy and safety
signals, and other pain points of patient health management.
The data model and annotated corpus enable us to extract
information from patient secure messages for systematic content
analysis and to resolve the challenges of data analysis and
integration by standardizing the unstructured data with the
structured data system. In future, this data model can be used
and extended to model patient narratives from social media
platforms [44] to analyze their content. Our future aim is to
leverage this data model and annotated corpus for developing
machine learning models and NLP-enabled parsing tools for
automatically parsing patient narratives to advance clinical
research and practice [45,46].
During annotation, we faced some challenges because of the
heterogeneous and superficial nature of the language used in
the messages, which often deviated from formal English
grammar, spelling, and punctuation rules. These challenges can
often lower the quality of the data and make them less accessible
to automated processing by a system. We discussed and
designed some solutions to overcome these challenges. The
challenges and their solutions are discussed in detail in
Multimedia Appendix 2. During the comparison between the 2
sets of the first set of annotation, the level of agreement between
the annotators was consistent for a few subconcepts, such as
appointment, diagnostic report, immunization, medication, and
practitioner. In contrast, it was very unsatisfactory for
subconcepts 
such 
as 
specimen, 
related-person,
document-reference, eligibility, and health care-service.
Although the 2 annotators achieved a satisfactory IAA score
later, annotation bias likely exists in the annotated corpus.
After analyzing the annotated corpus and identifying important
health concepts in patient secure messages, we further used
topic modeling to automatically uncover hidden topics of patient
secure messages mentioning health concepts [47]. In this way,
we were able to evaluate the data model and understand the
focus of patient discussion and concerns in the patient secure
messages. For example, prednisone, because it is a corticosteroid
drug that controls inflammation, was a highly discussed topic
in the patient secure messages. The patient-provider discussion
on prednisone was primarily centered around medication use,
side effects, and disease treatment [39-43]. These findings offer
useful information for shared clinical decision making and
patient-centered care. LDA exploits statistical inference to
identify latent topics using a bag-of-words model and term
frequency. Therefore, LDA mainly discovers topics with high
frequency and dominant terms and pays little attention to rare,
yet meaningful, topics from patient secure messages. In addition,
hypermeter tuning in LDA can be more art than science.
Our study is the first to develop a data model based on HL7
FHIR to understand and analyze the content of patient secure
messages. This study has several limitations. For annotation,
the F1 scores were 0.62 (macro mean) and 0.74 (micro mean).
This indicates that the task of annotation is a difficult one
because we need to assign 3-level hierarchical health concepts
to an identified health entity, and there are 85 microconcepts
to be selected in the data model. Our annotators not only need
to assign a category to these potential entities but also to identify
their boundaries. If the boundaries are defined differently by
different annotators, it is considered notconsistent. The language
used in patient secure messages to describe medical concepts
is casual, colloquial, and ambiguous. We revised our annotation
guideline 5 times and trained our annotators 4 times. We believe
that the F1 score could be improved, given more resources for
annotation.
All the messages analyzed in this study were sent by patients.
We did not analyze the messages generated by the clinicians
who read and replied to these patient secure messages. The
Mayo Clinic at Rochester, Minnesota, is a large nonprofit
academic medical center that provides comprehensive patient
care in the United States. We acknowledge that the patients and
medical practices at the Mayo Clinic are not necessarily a
representative cross-section of all patients and medical practices
in the country. It is also unknown how the data model can be
applied to other hospitals in other countries, given different
models of care and patient-clinician relationships. For example,
we are aware that in China, there are no patient portals, and
patients communicate with their providers through other means.

Thus, we share our model, annotation guideline, and other
materials with the broader scientific community and welcome
all sorts of collaboration or partnership.
Finally, we acknowledge that evaluation and validation are key
and challenging in this case. Strictly speaking, the data model
can only be validated for the claimed utilities in real-world
implementations. The topic modeling analysis we conducted
was only an initial and weak evaluation. We expect to conduct
a much more rigorous evaluation and validation by building
collaborations and partnerships with domestic and international
researchers in the field and by moving forward with building
the NLP systems.
In the next stage of our study, we aim to curate a larger
annotated corpus and use it for training and testing machine
learning models for automated triaging. The manually annotated
corpus is reusable for future NLP research to save manual effort
and cost, although there might be some challenges related to its
reuse because of data privacy and confidentiality challenges.
This corpus is also generated based on patient secure messages;
therefore, there always will remain a question of its usability
in different domains of medical research.
Conclusions
A patient portal as a tethered EHR system enables patients to
access their medical records, seek support, and share their
opinions with their caregivers through secure messaging between
their clinical visits. The large volume of secure messages opens
new opportunities and challenges for understanding patient
concerns and information integration into EHRs to improve
patient-centered care. This study is a novel attempt to identify
the content of patient secure messages based on the foundation
and base, clinical, and financial concepts of HL7 FHIR
standards. The data model and annotated corpus enable us to
meet the challenges of analyzing and understanding unstructured
health information from patient secure messages along with the
topic modeling technique to discover the hidden topics on
interesting health concepts in patient secure messages.
The data model could be potentially used for automatically
identifying and analyzing other types of patient narratives such
as those in various social media and patient forums. In the future,
we plan to develop a machine learning and NLP solution to
enable automatic triaging solutions to reduce the workload of
clinicians and perform more granular content analysis to
understand patients’ needs and improve patient-centered care.
