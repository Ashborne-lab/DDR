Abstract
Biomedical relation extraction is an important preliminary step for
knowledge discovery in the biomedical domain. This paper
proposes a multiple classifier system (MCS) for the extraction of
chemical-induced disease relations. A genetic algorithm (GA) is
employed to select classifier ensembles from a pool of base
classifiers. Moreover, the voting method used for combining the
members of each of the ensembles is also selected during evolution
in the GA framework. The performances of the MCSs are
determined by the algorithms used for selecting the classifiers, the
diversity among the selected classifiers, and the voting method used
in the classifier combination. The base classifiers are represented in
the form of chromosomes, where each chromosome contains all
information on the ensemble it represents: the subset of classifiers
voting and the voting method. The chromosomes are evolved using
a variety of genetic selection, mating, and mutation techniques in
order to find an optimal solution. The aim of the proposed system is
to select the subset of classifiers with diverse abilities while
maximizing the strengths of the best classifiers in the classifier
ensemble for a given voting method. Two main contributions of this
work are the evolution of the voting bit as part of the GA and the
novel approach of using two different decision-making under
uncertainty techniques as voting methods. Furthermore, two
different selection algorithms and crossover operators are employed
as ways of increasing variations during evolution. We validated our
proposed method on nine different experimental settings and they
produced good results comparable to the state-of-the-art systems,
thereby justifying our approach.
