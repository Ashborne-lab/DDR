About this book
This open access book describes the results of natural language
processing and machine learning methods applied to clinical text
from electronic patient records.
It is divided into twelve chapters. Chapters 1-4 discuss the history
and background of the original paper-based patient records, their
purpose, and how they are written and structured. These initial
chapters do not require any technical or medical background
knowledge. The remaining eight chapters are more technical in
nature and describe various medical classifications and
terminologies such as ICD diagnosis codes, SNOMED CT, MeSH,
UMLS, and ATC. Chapters 5-10 cover basic tools for natural
language processing and information retrieval, and how to apply
them to clinical text. The difference between rule-based and
machine learning-based methods, as well as between supervised and
unsupervised machine learning methods, are also explained. Next,
ethical concerns regarding the use of sensitive patient records
forresearch purposes are discussed, including methods for de-
identifying electronic patient records and safely storing patient
records. The book’s closing chapters present a number of
applications in clinical text mining and summarise the lessons
learned from the previous chapters.
The book provides a comprehensive overview of technical issues
arising in clinical text mining, and offers a valuable guide for
advanced students in health informatics, computational linguistics,
and information retrieval, and for researchers entering these fields.
